<p> Historic districts and historic district zoning have been proven as effective methods of community and neighborhood revitalization. Other that holding architectural or historical significance, preserving an area can have other beneficial impacts on the community, including economic and environmental benefits. 
One way to monitor the positive impact of historic districting is the vacancy rate of addresses in a neighborhood. Areas that have been designated as historic districts tend to have lower vacancy and foreclosure rates. The following series of maps highlights this trend in midwestern historic districts.
