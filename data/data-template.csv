Village Bar,43.060764,-89.438892,3801 Mineral Point Road,"<p>Westmorland's version of ""Cheers,"" where ""everyone knows your name,"" has been located at the corner of Mineral Point Road and Glenway Street for over eighty years. The bar is a classic Wisconsin tavern decorated with sports memorabilia, mainly Packers and UW Badgers, adorning the interior.</p> <p>The building in which the current Village Bar resides began as a single-family home located on the north side of the 1500 block of University Avenue and directly across from the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since the house was scheduled for demolition to make room for a new campus building, Theodore Herling moved the house in 1921 from its original location to 3801 Mineral Point Road by using a team of horses to pull the house along Speedway Road.</p> <p>Herling sold the building to his son, W.H. (Bill) Herling shortly after having it moved. Bill Herling converted the house into a general store that opened for business in 1921. Upon the appeal of Prohibition in 1933, he added a small bar in the corner of the store; thus ""Herling's Tavern"" was born. The tavern was nicknamed ""Windy Corners"" by regular customers due to the winds that blow in Mineral Point Road and across Glenway Golf Course (which opened in 1927).</p> <p>In 1944, Herling sold the building and the business to Robert (Bob) Waterman who then converted the entire interior into a bar and renamed the building ""Waterman's Bar."" Waterman ran the bar until February of 1953 when he sold the business to partners Frank Vitale and Joe Namio (who later opened Namio's Supper Club, a long time, popular eating establishment elsewhere in Madison); they then renamed the location the ""Village Bar."" Vitale retired in 1978 and sold the business to Leo and Jan Castle. After running the Village Bar for twenty-one years the Castles then sold the business to the current owners, Mark and Karen Kampa, in January of 1999.</p>",img/westmor/bar.png,Tom Martinelli
