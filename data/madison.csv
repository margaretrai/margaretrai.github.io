Village Bar,43.060764,-89.438892,3801 Mineral Point Road,"<p>Westmorland's version of ""Cheers,"" where ""everyone knows your name,"" has been located at the corner of Mineral Point Road and Glenway Street for over eighty years. The bar is a classic Wisconsin tavern decorated with sports memorabilia, mainly Packers and UW Badgers, adorning the interior.</p> <p>The building in which the current Village Bar resides began as a single-family home located on the north side of the 1500 block of University Avenue and directly across from the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since the house was scheduled for demolition to make room for a new campus building, Theodore Herling moved the house in 1921 from its original location to 3801 Mineral Point Road by using a team of horses to pull the house along Speedway Road.</p> <p>Herling sold the building to his son, W.H. (Bill) Herling shortly after having it moved. Bill Herling converted the house into a general store that opened for business in 1921. Upon the appeal of Prohibition in 1933, he added a small bar in the corner of the store; thus ""Herling's Tavern"" was born. The tavern was nicknamed ""Windy Corners"" by regular customers due to the winds that blow in Mineral Point Road and across Glenway Golf Course (which opened in 1927).</p> <p>In 1944, Herling sold the building and the business to Robert (Bob) Waterman who then converted the entire interior into a bar and renamed the building ""Waterman's Bar."" Waterman ran the bar until February of 1953 when he sold the business to partners Frank Vitale and Joe Namio (who later opened Namio's Supper Club, a long time, popular eating establishment elsewhere in Madison); they then renamed the location the ""Village Bar."" Vitale retired in 1978 and sold the business to Leo and Jan Castle. After running the Village Bar for twenty-one years the Castles then sold the business to the current owners, Mark and Karen Kampa, in January of 1999.</p>",img/westmor/bar.png,Tom Martinelli
Brunsell House,43.05885,-89.44247,442 Toepfer Avenue,"<p>A handful of International-style homes are found on Madison's west side, including a significant, if modified, example at 442 Toepfer Avenue. Originally, the Elmer Brunsell house was a modest, one-story dwelling; but in 2008 it was expanded significantly with a second-story addition.</p><p>The house was designed by local architects Beatty and Strang and built by brothers Elmer and William Brunsell in 1937. Shortly after the brothers formed the Brunsell Lumber and Millwork Company, which has since been a major supplier of building materials for the Madison area. Beatty and Strang often partnered with Brunsell, but this particular house is especially interesting as it was built for Elmer Brunsell's family.</p><p>Hamilton Beatty became partial to the International style after studying it in France, and formed the architecture firm with Allen Strang. Though many homebuyers were wary of the modern designs that Beatty and Strang and the Brunsell brothers produced, Madison residents became quickly receptive when compared to national trends. </p><p>An article on an exhibit featuring Madison architects, published in a 1941 issue of the Wisconsin State Journal offers evidence of the popularity of modern styles. The article presents the results of a survey of housing preferences in which eleven percent of Americans voted in favor of modern styles (versus classic colonial styles), whereas thirty-four percent of Madison residents expressed a preference for modernist examples. </p><p>The author concluded that the popularity of local architects, such as William Kaeser and Beatty and Strang, who were featured in exhibits similar to the one mentioned in the article, contributed to the greater preference of Madisonians for modernist styles.</p><p>Aside from being designed by well-respected architects, many of the homes constructed during this era were marketed as modest, low-cost houses. A description of a series of Beatty and Strang homes in a 1938 Wisconsin State Journal article marketed them as ""a compact, low-cost, modern home, which can grow with the family."" These homes were typically one or two stories with two to three bedrooms, allowing for variations and opportunities for expansion. The chance for new homebuyers to purchase a cost-effective home that also allowed for expansion was a very attractive feature in Beatty and Strang designs.</p>",img/westmor/brunsell.png,Margaret Raimann
Herbert & Katherine Jacobs House,43.05879,-89.44147,441 Toepfer Avenue,"<p>The first Katherine and Herbert Jacobs House stands out in the Westmorland neighborhood as one of only a few architect-designed houses. Although designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, already by then a world-renowned architect, it materialized from his lifelong ""Usonian"" vision to house middle-class Americans. Like Wright himself, the house is significant as a national model as well as regionally; indeed, the James Wilkie House just around the corner is modeled directly after it.</p><p>The house was constructed in 1937 for Katherine and Herbert Jacobs, who enlisted Wright to construct a low-priced house by following his Usonian drawings. </p><p> During the Great Depression, housing starts had slowed, and thus architects such as Wright were exploring new kinds of commissions. Wright's lack of work during the Depression, however, was not his only motivation to build the house for the Jacobs. After moving from Milwaukee, Herb and Katherine Jacobs visited the Taliesin Fellowship in 1936. Upon meeting the couple, Wright took to them on a personal level and was willing to build the modest-cost home that the couple desired.</p><p>The house, which covers two lots on the east side of Toepfer Avenue, employs an L-shape plan, with the living-dining-kitchen in the main block and a bedroom wing off the back. In addition to the house, Wright designed the interior furnishings, including built-ins, furniture, and lighting, much of which survives or has been restored. </p><p>Due to Wright's lack of work during the Depression, he was also instrumental in construction activities associated with the house. To keep costs low, Wright used locally sourced materials such as leftover brick from his work on the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin, which is located just over one hundred miles southeast of Madison. </p><p>The Jacobs family did not live in the house for an extended period of time. According to city directories they had moved by 1946, when Max Pohle took over the property. When Herb Jacobs developed an interest in farming, he moved his family towards the City of Middleton, located northwest of Madison; once again they hired Wright to build another house for them (Jacobs II).</p><p>Jacobs I received its designation as a Madison City Landmark in 1974, although at that time it was in need of extensive restoration. Today, Jacobs I is fully restored, a process that began after James Dennis, a Professor in the Department of Art History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, purchased the home in 1983.</p><p> Dennis maintained Wright's original design with little deviation. The carport was a telling case. Since mid-century carports were not suitable for Midwestern climatic conditions, many Madisonians converted them into garages. Nevertheless, Dennis's restoration team renovated the carport to its original state, since it is a distinct design feature of Wright's homes. The concrete slab in the house was completely repoured and the roof replaced with a rubber membrane. </p><p>Another major job involved the removal of a creosote preservative from the exterior Ponderosa pine boards and redwood battens, as well as the removal of red paint trim from the windows and doors. As part of the renovation Dennis also created features from the original plans that had not been completed, such as a flower box in the front of the house. In addition to its local landmark status, Jacobs I was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003 and is now under consideration as a potential nomination to the 'U.S. World Heritage Tentative List.' </p>",img/westmor/jacobs.png,Margaret Raimann
Sears House,43.05946,-89.445591,425 Holly Avenue,"<p>Although the heyday of homebuilding in Westmorland was after World War II, a sizable number of buildings were erected during the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p> Of houses built during the interwar period two have been documented as ""Sears Homes"", at 425 Holly Avenue and 4021 Winnemac.

It is a one-story Cape Cod home, with two bedrooms, kitchen, small dining alcove, living room, and one bathroom.

James Wilkie House,43.059072,-89.440418,3909 Euclid Avenue,"<p>In 1938, shortly after Frank Lloyd Wright built the first Katherine and Herbert Jacobs House, William Kaeser built a strikingly similar house just around the corner at 3909 Euclid Avenue. Although Kaeser began his professional career as Madison's first city planner in 1935, he left that position a few years later to devote himself to architecture, claiming that city development in the government took too long to materialize. Inspired by the ideals of the Wright's Usonian houses, Kaeser designed and produced a number of houses based on the models of Wright. </p><p>The plan of the James Wilkie House is almost a direct copy of Wright's first usonian model home. What makes Kaeser's home in Westmorland interesting, along with the other residential dwellings he built, is his own interpretation of Wright's organic architecture practices.</p><p> According to Kaeser scholar Anne Biebel, Kaeser was able to distinguish himself from Wright and his Taliesen apprentices through integration of his graduate studies with Eliel Saarinen. Kaeser learned to not completely dismiss the emerging International or modern styles, as Wright did, and instead combine them with organic styles idealized for Usonia. </p><p>When Kaeser left his position as a city planner, he also dismissed residential development in the urban core. His primary projects early in his career were in the suburbs, especially in the Villages of Maple Bluff and Shorewood Hills, which are both located along Lake Mendota. Taking to the natural architecture and building with the topography of the area, Kaeser was able to carry out his own regionalist modernism.</p><p>While Kaeser attempted to distinguish himself from Wright, it was difficult to ignore Wright's influence on the city of Madison.  Upon entering the architecture field, Kaeser experimented with Wright's Usonian ideals by taking features of Usonian houses, like Jacobs I, and attempted to distinguish his structure with different materials. </p><p>Both the Wilkie and Jacobs I houses are constructed in an L-shaped plan. Although Wright intended his house as a low-cost middle-class home, Kaeser's was even more about cost efficiency; his house is downscaled in size as well as materials. </p><p>Both homes also set a precedent for post-World War II suburban ideals of privacy seen elsewhere in the neighborhood (and throughout the United States). The front of each home is situation in a low position on the hill with narrow window bands placed toward the top. The backs of the homes, meanwhile, are lined with tall windows, which allow the residents to experience nature while still having their desired privacy. </p>",img/westmor/wilkie.png,Margaret Raimann
McBurney House,43.057134,-89.447922,505 S. Owen Drive,"<p>The McBurney House is an intact example of a Lustron home, a notable attempt at post-World War II prefabricated housing. Even though the Lustron Corporation went bankrupt in 1950 after producing only 2,000 of the 30,000 residences they had anticipated selling, their product still marks a turning point in suburban housing, which is especially evident in Westmorland today.</p><p> In Madison, Lustron homes were constructed by J. H. Findorff & Sons, Inc., a local contractor still in business today. There are at least twenty-two Lustrons still found in the area, seven of which are located in Westmorland . </p><p>The Lustron home at 505 South Owen Drive is a blue, Westchester two-bedroom deluxe model, measuring 31 by 35 feet, one of the Lustron Corporation's most popular models. Other Lustron homes in Westmorland, all Westchesters, are located at 3810 Saint Clair Street, 534 Glenway Street, 513 South Owen Drive, 548 South Owen Drive, 537 Gately Terrace, and 418 Critchell Terrace. Most were constructed in 1949, at the end of Lustron's home-production activities.</p><p>Robert and Jane McBurney bought the house in 1949 and hired Findorff to erect it. McBurney, an Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, sold the house in 1951, when he left the University and Madison. William Deming bought the house in 1951, but moved out within a year. In 1952 Ernest Goeldner and his wife, Carol, moved into the home. Ernest was a dispatcher for LCL Transit, and Carol an office secretary for the Stemp Typewriter Company; she owned the home after Ernest's death in 1954, and stayed until 1956 when Kenneth Fishburn, a driver for Bulk Transport, bought the house.</p><p> In 1964, the dwelling was turned over once again, this time to Lucille Jacobson. From this list of owners, it is possible to see the increasing numbers of working class families that were able to purchase homes during the post-World War II housing boom. </p><p>John Sylvester, a local Madison radio personality, now lives in the Lustron Home at 505 S. Owen Drive, which he purchased in 1996. Because of the limited number of houses that were manufactured by the Lustron Corporation, as well as the unique features of the home, Sylvester purchased another Lustron that provided elements for the restoration of the interior. </p>",img/westmor/mcburney.png,Margaret Raimann
Westmorland Park,43.054714,-89.445084,Tokay Boulevard,"<p>Further enriching Westmorland's landscape was the addition of a public park in 1944. Starting around 1941, the park proposal was under consideration by the Madison Town Board. </p><p>An article in a September 1941 issue of the Capital Times reported on the park approval process and noted the presence of Westmorland residents, including Herb Jacobs (owner of the Jacobs House) who was President of the Westmorland Community Association at the time. The park was eventually approved by the City of Madison under the stipulation that Westmorland cover a considerable proportion of construction costs.</p><p> Despite the financial difficulties, the neighborhood's residents came together to fund the purchase of the park land by making five-dollar payments to the Westmorland Community Association.</p><p>Since its development, Westmorland Park has served as a rich cultural landscape for the neighborhood. </p><p>Events such as the Fourth of July parade and picnic were centered on the park, which provided Westmorland's residents with a sense of community through the difficult war years and beyond. The park not only came at a pivotal time in the nation's history, but also at a time of major development activities in Westmorland. The neighborhood was re-platted shortly after the construction of the park, which integrated it into the neighborhood plan.</p> <p>Westmorland Park may have initially supported the ideals of post-war suburbia, but the realities of vandalism struck the park during the 1960s. </p><p>A 1963 article in the Wisconsin State Journal reported that Westmorland Park was known for recurring vandalism and had become a place where parents were reluctant to allow their children to play. While Westmorland Park has subsequently became a desirable place for residents, articles with such titles as Park Vandals vs. Improvement, help to document the contrast between postwar suburban ideals and reality. </p>",img/westmor/park.png,Margaret Raimann
Stone Gates,43.060644,-89.443722,Westmorland Boulevard & Mineral Point Road,"<p>A sturdy pair of stone walls marks the main entrance to the Westmorland neighborhood. In December of 1926, the Westmorland Company, one of a series of Westmorland developers, hatched plans to develop a section of the neighborhood just south of Mineral Point Road. They constructed Westmorland Boulevard with a wide median and the gates in hopes of attracting buyers. </p><p>This may have been adopted as a strategy because of the nearby Nakoma neighborhood, which had similar gates marking the entrance to its fashionable suburban homes.</p><p> The Company's plans, however, came at the start of the Depression, and the historic photograph from 1930 shows that despite the grand aspirations symbolized by the gates, the development failed to materialize as quickly as its founders had hoped.</p><p>The gates were built of local sandstone, perhaps from the stone quarry located about a half mile away. Originally the gates were designed with wrought iron signage and lanterns in the openings in the stonework. The Westmorland Neighborhood Association is planning to restore these during 2012.</p>",img/westmor/gates.png,Anna Andrzejewski
William R. Warren Barn,43.059908,-89.442229,4010 Paunack Avenue,"<p>The oldest structure still standing in Westmorland was built as a barn and stable during the 1860s and now stands as a residence at 4010 Paunack Avenue. </p><p>The cut sandstone-walled building was originally built over one-hundred-fifty years ago by William R. Warren, who owned the eighty acres that stretched from Mineral Point Road to south of the future Illinois Central Railroad grade (built in 1887) and from Glenway Street to the current Westmorland Boulevard. (There also is a small storage shed from the same era built with rough sandstone walls that now stands in the backyard at 3822 Paunack Avenue in another section of the former Warren farm.)</p><p> The property then became the Charles Baker Sunnyside Farm"" from 1890 until 1899, when it was purchased by Otto Toepfer, Jr. Toepfer used the barn as a stable for his horses, cows, and chickens, with hay storage on the upper level. Toepfer owned the barn, along with his 1906 home at 4001 Mineral Point Road, until 1930, when he sold both buildings to a prominent Madison banker, A. O. Paunack.</p><p>The Paunack family occupied the home on Mineral Point Road and owned the adjacent property until September of 1937, when Professor James March and his wife, Mildred (Billie), purchased the property and moved their young family into the former Toepfer home. </p><p>It is believed that the Marchs converted the barn to a home around 1938 and rented it out beginning in 1939. At some point during the late 1940s a wood-frame addition was added to the east side. The current owners of the home offered it as a stop on Historic Madison's Alternate Parade of Homes event in Westmorland on June 5, 2011.   </p>",img/westmor/barn.png,Tom Martinelli
Otto Toepfer House,43.060732,-89.442068,4001 Mineral Point Road,"<p>One of the earliest standing houses in Westmorland and certainly the most grand is the Otto Toepfer House, which stands at the corner of Mineral Point Road and what would become Toepfer Avenue. The imposing two-and-one-half story seven-bedroom brick house is 3,927 square feet in size, making it still the largest house in Westmorland.</p><p> The house was befitting Toepfer's status as a political figure, active as a Dane County Supervisor for nineteen years, and a land developer. </p><p>Toepfer acquired sixty acres on which to build his house in 1899 in conjunction with his brother, who later sold his interest to Otto. At the time, it was part of the Charles Baker Sunnyside Farm, bounded by present-day Mineral Point Road, Westmorland Boulevard, Tokay Boulevard, and Glenway Street. The house (former barn) at 4010 Paunack was part of this property. </p><p>Toepfer likely purchased this land with an eye toward development. Along with A.O. Paunack, he was responsible with much of the pre-World War II development of Westmorland. Today Toepfer is known as ""father of Westmorland"" and his house as the ""Toepfer Mansion.""</p>",img/westmor/toepfer.png,Anna Andrzejewski
Rudin House,43.06556,-89.46901,110 Marinette Trail,"<p>The Rudin House was a prototype for the second of the Wright-Erdman prefabricated houses planned during the late 1950s, a collaboration by the world-renowned architect and Madison-based builder that was intended to bring fine design into an affordable realm. </p><p>Built as part of the 1959 Parade of Homes, the two-story house stands out from the ranches and split levels that dominate the Hill Farms neighborhood while also responding to many of the same factors that influenced other builders in 1950s Madison.</p> <p>Like other Madison builders in the 1959 Parade, Erdman sought to cater to the specific interests and needs of his immediate clients. In the case of University Hill Farms these homeowners and purchasers were typically upper-middle-class professionals, professors, and businessmen.</p><p> Collaborating with Wright allowed Erdman the chance to bring elements of Wright's design to these clients in hopes of expanding his already successful prefabricated housing business.</p><p>The house stands at an angle to the street on a wooded lot noticeably larger than most of the others in the subdivision. While most of the nearby homes are arranged parallel or perpendicular to the street, the entrance to the Rudin House is tucked in a corner close to the attached carport. During the summer months the house and its large corner windows are partly obscured from the street, thereby lending the occupants much privacy.</p><p> The exterior is a painted board (stress-skin) and redwood batten system similar to other Wright-designed houses from the period. The house is capped by a flat roof with wide overhanging eaves. The interior exhibits an open plan centered around a two-story living space with windows on two walls extending from floor to ceiling, described by the Parade of Homes plan book as ""lending the room a feeling of infinite space and comfort."" A large concrete block fireplace separates the living room from the adjacent kitchen, dining, and entry halls with an open staircase running up one side of it leading to bedrooms and a bathroom in the lofted second story. </p><p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of the design is its openness. </p><p>The plan is derived from Wright's conception of the one-room house; rather than using doors, folding screens are employed to allow all spaces, including those that are typically private, to remain largely open to each other. A few of the walls that separate the bedrooms from the living room and each other also have these folding screens, which allows the entire interior to open up. Even with the screen tightly closed, sound easily passes from room to room.</p><p>Erdman intended the design of this prefabricated house to allow a small, affordable house to have a degree of beauty and spaciousness lacking in most houses of similar size. In the end, however, the house was not all that affordable, especially in comparison to others in the 1959 Hill Farms Parade of Homes. </p><p>The advertised cost was in the range of $38,000 to $45,000 while most of the surrounding homes cost half that amount. Much of this was due to site work and masonry (in the fireplace and the fully excavated basement). Much of the cost can probably be attributed to the experimentation, uniqueness, and ironically, the modularity of the home, a product of the Wright-Erdman collaboration.</p><p> The pair had worked on a number of projects in the Madison region during the previous decade, beginning with the Unitarian Meeting House, and their relationship was a symbiotic one. Erdman was happy to use Wright's name and prestige to advertise his work while Wright found someone willing to help him realize his ideas about affordable housing (at least partially). The design and construction of the Rudin House was praised in the local and national media (including a feature in House and Home). </p><p>The Rudin House was by far the most popular house on Parade that year, but the house did not sell immediately. Perhaps the high price was a factor in this, but in reality, no one actually wanted to live there. Walter and Mart Ellen Rudin, two successful Department of Mathematics professors at the University of Wisconsin, eventually purchased the property a few months after the Parade of Homes had ended. They had been on the Parade and seen a number of homes as they were looking for a place to raise a family, but had skipped viewing 110 Marinette Trail. Mary Ellen recalls that the concept of the one-room house and geometric aesthetic were appealing to her and her husband when they purchased the house. </p><p>The strikingly open floor plan became the defining feature as they raised their three children. Mary Ellen Rudin still resides at 110 Marinette Trail and is still fond of the house. Little has changed in the house since its construction. The original kitchen appliances and cabinets remain. The only major changes are renovations to the first-floor bathroom and a replacement (this year) of woodpecker-damaged fascia.</p>",img/hillfarms/rudin.png ,Rowan Davidson and Anna Andrejewski
Skilton House,43.06381,-89.46897,5217 Pepin Place,"<p>The Skilton House, No. 3 on the 1959 Parade of Homes, is an example of a split-level residence. Described in the Parade of Homes plan book as ""a practical bi-level that fits a difficult site,"" with "". . . a grade level door in back with a large garage,"" the design of the house emphasized distinguishing zones by level, noting ""the main level has everything needed, with the other functions downstairs."" </p><p>This fairly simple language covers a number of innovations in the form and layout of the 1950s house, which shows improvements on the popular ranch design of the period found elsewhere on the 1959 Parade.</p><p>The lot's steep incline meant the house had to be banked into the side of the hill, making the bi-level design particularly appropriate in this case. The house is more specifically a split foyer design, with the front entrance leading directly into an open stairwell, which leads to two distinct floors.</p><p> In the 1959 Parade of Homes plan book this layout is referred to as a ""bi-level"" and lists a number of outlined advantages, including an ""interior"" garage, an emphasis on the rear of the house, and a separation of the living spaces away from the public street below. As the Parade of Homes description states, the plan includes all of what one would come to expect from a ranch house plan on the second floor: kitchen, living room, bathrooms, and bedrooms. This pattern left the basement free for other functions, most likely a family/recreational room or ""den."" </p><p>Robert Skilton, a Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, and his wife, Betty, purchased the house shortly after the Parade of Homes in 1959 and lived there until the late 1960s. Like many of the initial owners in University Hill Farms, the Skiltons had a young family and an upper-middle class lifestyle. One might assume that they shared the desire for privacy and the inward focus that was so prevalent when they bought their home.</p><p> The split-level house likely fit their lifestyle, with the lower level likely functioning as a recreational/family room or den, which was becoming fashionable in this period. The autocentric character of the community is also emphasized here with the two-car garage, which is integrated here to such an extent that it almost seems a part of the ""family."" </p>",img/hillfarms/skilton.png,Rowan Davidson
Kalal House,43.06536,-89.4679,111 Marinette Trail,"<p>The Kalal House is in many ways a typical single-story ranch house. Horizontal in orientation, the house contains with a long, low-pitched gable roof, a two-car garage, and large windows intended to bring in the outdoors. More unusual is the house's position on the lot.</p><p> Rather than paralleling the street, the Kalal House is rotated ninety degrees so the front door and large windows face the driveway. All of the other ranch houses in the 1959 Parade of Homes Plan Book run horizontally along the lot.</p><p>One reason for the siting could be the lot's location on a hill. Simply turning the ranch home maintained the style, alleviated complications of the lot's hillside location, and the convenience of living in one story home was not lost. Still, it required some adjustments.</p><p> The side of the home with the most glazing, the long ""rear"" elevation, required a row of large trees to act as a screen between the two homes. In a sense, this does follow the conventional characteristics of the postwar ranch house's tendency to shift focus from the front of the house to the backyard, but because of the siting, it had to rely on landscape treatments to allow for desired privacy.</p><p>Like other houses on the 1959 Parade of Homes, the Kalal House was speculatively built. In May of 1959 merchant-builder Donald Sampson acquired the lot that the home sits on from the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. Just three months later Gladys Kalal secured a mortgage from First Federal Savings and Loan for $19,000 and purchased the house. </p><p>Kalal was a very active local musician, participating in church groups, the Madison Symphony Orchestra, the Madison Federated Music Club, and other local groups. Ten years after she moved into the home, the Capital Times published a section containing short biographical sketches with members of the Madison Symphony Orchestra. In it she describes herself as ""A frustrated interior decorator."" Such was one of the challenges with a speculatively built house, which allowed someone with an interest in design fewer options than a custom-built home.</p>",img/hillfarms/kalal.png,Jared Lowery
Moore House,43.0648,-89.46764,5142 Pepin Place,"<p>The Joseph and Violette Moore House is an L-shaped ranch house with a strong emphasis on privacy. During the 1950s, popular magazines such as House Beautiful promoted the concept of an insular, family-centered home. The Parade of Homes Plan Book touts privacy as the most distinguishing feature of the design, noting ""the living room was away from traffic."" </p><p>The house is arranged in an L-shape, with the forward-facing gable-roofed section containing three bedrooms and a bathroom. The ""rear"" arm of the ell parallel to the street is dominated by a large two-car garage; an entrance is located to the right of the garage. The exterior is sheathed in painted wood lap siding; brick veneer adds visual variety near the entrance, perhaps to draw some attention to the front door, which would otherwise be hard to see from the street. Near the entry alcove is a small window to the kitchen, the only place in the communal family spaces that allows for visual access to the street. These communal spaces, the kitchen, dining area, and living room, have large windows facing the fenced backyard of the house. </p><p>Extensive vegetation also serves to enclose this private family area. In contrast, the bedroom areas closer to the street have small, unobtrusive windows at eye-level or higher to prevent those on the street from looking directly into the house.</p><p>The history of the house's occupation affirms the middle- to upper-middle-class socio-economic status of residents in University Hill Farms. The house was purchased during the 1959 Parade of Homes by Joseph and Violette Moore, who at the time worked for K&M cleaners. Joseph worked for most of his career as a car salesman at Zimbrick Buick whereas Violette worked as a legal secretary while raising their three children.  </p><p>Ownership of the house was transferred to the children before their parents passed away; in 1981, they sold the house to Richard Porter, a young Professor of Chemistry, and his wife, Nancy. The Porters only lived in the house for a few years. In 1984, Lee and Rosemary Jones purchased the property. Lee worked as a market analyst for Ohmeda Anesthetics in Madison and passed away some time ago. </p>",img/hillfarms/moore.png ,Rowan Davidson and Anna Andrejewski
Peterson House,43.0642,-89.46723,5201 Pepin Place,"<p>The Peterson House is a typical ranch house of the late 1950s. The Ninth Annual Parade of Homes book boasts the house has ""two dining areas, two fireplaces,  a second bath and a large porch, all features found in more expensive homes."" Jevne offered this design in the 1959 Parade in an attempt to appeal to the upper middle-class suburban residents who typically contacted him for custom built homes as well as stock designs. </p><p>Many of this house's features typify ranch houses across the country. The home is arranged on its site parallel to the street with an attached garage off to one side and a large fenced backyard in the rear. The facade displays a large picture window looking out from the living room, a central door and smaller windows for the bedrooms; the rear elevation is more informal with a patio, rear door, and kitchen window with a view to the spacious backyard. </p><p>The roof is of the low, gabled variety with a centrally-located chimney. There is very little ornament and materials are exposed following modernist trends.  The plan is based around a central hall leading from the front entrance. All the private functions, bedrooms and baths, are off to one side while the more public spaces, like the kitchen, dining, and living room are on the other. Rather unusually, there is no direct access from the garage into the body of the house.</p><p> The only other distinguishing feature has to do with the Lannon stone facing on the facade and chimney, which is a type of local limestone used across Wisconsin since the mid-nineteenth century. By the mid- to late 1950s, Lannon stone was used as an accent material, readily apparent throughout Hill Farms. </p><p>This house was purchased in 1959 by Gustoff and Bessie Peterson, shortly after the 1959 Parade of Homes. Gustoff was an associate professor in the UW Botany department, and the family stayed in the home for nearly thirty years. </p><p>Besides the commonly assumed concerns for privacy, family, and recreation, it is possible that the Petersons were also interested in the appearance of identity and class when they bought their new home. Along with the conformity of the period there was also an undercurrent of individuality, and the irony that in order to fit in one had to express themselves outwardly. With this in mind it is possible to read the presence of Lannon stone veneer on the Peterson's house as type of regionalism unique to Wisconsin, and Madison in particular. </p>",img/hillfarms/peterson.png,Rowan Davidson
Boldon House,43.06464,-89.46867,5222 Pepin Place,"<p>A comparison of the plan and the street view of Keith Anderson's 1959 Parade of Homes entry shows two trends in house design emerging in the second half of the 1950s in Madison. The exterior presents the renewed interests in elements of colonial design.  </p><p>These references to the historic past made their first Parade appearance during the 1958 show, located several blocks away on Juneau Road. While this house retains its divided light windows, strapwork hinges on the garage doors, and dormers, it has lost the cupola and weathervane that were once located over the garage and its board shutters. </p><p>The innovations are on the interior, in what the Parade brochure termed ""a modern, efficient planning concept."" While the main public rooms of the house are at street level, the back of the house is split, resulting in living spaces spread over four levels. What appears to be a story and half relative of the Cape Cod is in reality a 2,600 square foot house designed with six bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a large family room, and a two-car garage.  </p><p>Builder Keith Anderson's had previous entries in the Parade of Homes, including a 1957 house on Richland Lane and a 1958 dwelling on Juneau Road. The 1958 house also displayed the divided light windows and the Parade brochure termed it a ""Colonial Ranch."" Keith Anderson (1926-2003) remained an active member of the Madison Builders Association and for several years was the president of the Parade of Homes event. His obituary noted that he left the Madison area a legacy of over two hundred quality homes. He also served on the Dane County Zoning Board. </p><p>Dr. Edward Boldon, a surgeon, his wife, Harriet, and their four children were the home's first and long-term residents. </p>",img/hillfarms/boldon.png,Daina Penkiunas
Bradley House ,43.069817,-89.421225, 106 North Prospect Avenue  ,"<p>The Bradley House, designed by the office of Louis Sullivan, is one of the largest and most distinctive homes in University Heights. The T-shaped plan of the house sprawls over several city lots with the main facade fronting to the south and a long wing that extends northward. The main east-west axis of the house has large overhanging eaves and porches on the second floor at each end that are supported by steel cantilevered beams encased in elaborately carved wood. The use of these muscular and salient cantilevered elements is one of the primary design elements and a reflection, like the T-shaped plan, of the nearby Gilmore House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p><p> The main entrance is located at the extreme northern end of the building with a porte cochere, from which one enters the main long hall that follows the primary axis of the house. The roof consists of two low and long intersecting gables sitting on vertical brick piers that interrupt the otherwise horizontal emphasis of the design. Many of the original windows, which had intricate patterned and multi-colored stained glass, are missing.</p><p>The house was a wedding present from wealthy Chicago plumbing magnate Charles Crane to his daughter, Josephine, and her husband, Dr. Harold Bradley, who was a professor of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin Hospital. The home quickly proved too large for the Bradley's needs even as their family grew; therefore, they sold the building to the local Sigma Phi Fraternity in 1914. </p><p>With its many bedrooms, bathrooms, and a large kitchen, the house was clearly designed for a very large family, which made it easily adaptable for use as a fraternity or office space. Sigma Phi transitioned the space from an active fraternity house to their national offices; it is still used in this capacity today.  A 1972 fire destroyed much of the interior and the building had to be rebuilt and repaired. Following these repairs the house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.</p><p>There is some debate over the role that Sullivan played in the design and supervision of the Bradley House. While he is typically credited with the design of the original architecture, furniture, draperies, rugs, and windows, it is possible that his chief assistant, George Elmslie, a notable Prairie style architect in his own right, took the lead. </p><p>Sullivan only designed two houses during the twentieth century (the Bradley House being one), and his work rarely fully embraced the details and motifs of the Prairie school. Elmslie, on the other hand, was well-versed in the new stylistic language that owed much to Sullivan's previous work. By this point in the waning years of Sullivan's career it is generally believed that Elmslie assumed a large share of design responsibilities, and the honeymoon cottage"" for Charles Crane's daughter and son-in-law was likely no exception.</p><p> Regardless of who served as the primary designer it is interesting to contrast the house with other Prairie style homes in the neighborhood, especially when considering the extent and quality of the building as well as Sullivan's philosophical influence on many other designers of University Heights residences.</p>",img/uHeights/bradley.png,Rowan Davidson
Breese Terrace ,43.071895,-89.413904,Breese Terrace,"<p>The development of University Heights has not been limited exclusively to single- family homes. At the edges of the neighborhood, apartments and flats quickly appeared after the area was incorporated into the city of Madison in 1903. This diversity is limited mainly to the physical edges of the area, specifically at the northern edge along University Avenue and the eastern border along Breese Terrace. </p><p>The eastern boundary facing Camp Randall stadium contains a mix of housing types including apartment complexes, three-story flats, and single-family homes. Also significant is the fact that, with the exception of the northern-most block of the street, the rest was platted separately from the original late nineteenth-century University Heights plat. Its development is more closely tied to the wider fabric of Madison than the curvilinear lots and high-end homes of University Heights.</p><p>Breese Terrace, formally spelled ""Breeze"" until the 1930s, is located east of University Heights at the base of the hill, basically buffering the enclave of single-family homes from the University. It stretches four blocks south from the First Congregational Church at University Avenue to the intersection of Regent and Monroe streets. </p><p>As the city grew the streetcar line was extended. As University Heights developed a stop was created near the intersection of University Avenue and Breese Terrace; the line was extended down Breese Terrace to Monroe Street in 1897. These streetcar lines served suburban growth and proximity to the stops likely encouraged density.</p>",img/uHeights/breese.png,Rowan Davidson
Elliot House ,43.070744,-89.419372, 137 Prospect Avenue ,"<p>No building permit or architectural drawings survive for the Elliot House. There is some debate over the attribution of the design to George Maher or Claude and Starck. Regardless of who was the responsible architect, the house is an excellent example of the Prairie style.</p><p> The entry displays a flared entrance door surround and a cantilevered roof in the shape of a segmented arch. The door is flanked by a set of tall windows with art glass sidelights that contain intricate lilac motifs. Similar windows and naturalistic stained-glass designs are also found on the second floor. Belt courses on the upper portion serve to highlight the horizontal feel of the house. The lines of the low-pitched hipped roof, with dormers on the sides and rear as well as large overhanging eaves, give the house a massive and horizontal feel. </p><p>Like other non-Wrightian prairie examples in Madison, the roughly square plan of the house is divided into distinct rooms rather than embracing a more open arrangement, as in Wright-designed examples. The house has a porch on its east side that transitions into a partial octagon with only five sides on the second floor. It is notable that the overall design compares closely with the 1907 Schultz House, designed by George Maher in Winnetka, Illinois; it differs only in the use of horizontal battens at the second floor level and the lack of a ribbon effect in the windows.</p><p>Edward Elliot, a Professor of Education at UW-Madison and the original owner of the house, came to Madison in 1905 from Columbia University to direct teacher's training programs for the state of Wisconsin. An education reformer, he met a great deal of resistance initially, but would go on to some success in 1911 with his central role in the establishment of the University of Wisconsin High School.</p><p> Shortly after this achievement, he left with his family to become the Chancellor of the University of Montana; and in 1922 he became President of Purdue University. The Elliots appear to have kept ownership of their new home in University Heights through 1924, when they sold it to Mrs. Nellie Hess. During the 1950s Hess sold the property to John (a UW-Madison professor) and Barbara Ferry.</p><p>Perhaps the most likely arrangement was that Maher designed the house while Claude and Starck, a local firm, oversaw the construction. This situation was not uncommon for Claude and Starck, who had a close working relationship with Maher and other prairie style architects who worked in Madison. Many homes designed for wealthy clients by Maher in Chicago suburbs follow a similar arrangement to the Elliot House. </p><p>While working in Silsbee's office during the late nineteenth century, alongside Frank Lloyd Wright and others, Maher also drew inspiration from the work of Charles Voysey and Edwin Lutyens and the British Arts and Crafts movement, which can be seen in the stability and heaviness of the Elliot House design.</p>",img/uHeights/elliot.png,Rowan Davidson
Ely House ,43.071849,-89.416586,205 Prospect Avenue ,"<p>One of the first residences built in University Heights, the Ely House, is an excellent example of nineteenth-century eclecticism preceding the so-called progressive"" designs that would follow in the neighborhood. A two-story wood-frame Georgian Revival design by the architect Charles Sumner Frost, the house is a Victorian adaptation of the historic Longfellow House in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><p> Its narrow clapboard siding, symmetrical facade, and classical elements clearly draw inspiration from Colonial American styles.  These colonial elements can be found in the materials used and the simple rectangular massing with small dormers and classical proportions. </p><p>A high-pitched roof with dormer windows tops a classically inspired cornice. The central pediments situated below project slightly and are supported by pilasters, which give the house a classical effect. A one-story ionic portico projects from the front entrance. Elaborate frames and woodworking around the windows and doors place the design in a more Victorian tradition.</p><p>Richard Ely, the original owner and builder of the house, played a large role in the development of University Heights. A member of the original University Heights Company, he also continued in the role of neighborhood booster and developer for many years after moving to the area. </p><p>Ely came to Madison in 1892 to organize the new Departments of Economics, Political Science, and History at the University of Wisconsin. Famous in his own time, Ely soon became the director of the economics department. </p><p>Taking a significantly more progressive view than that of economics establishment, Ely was willing to debate the laissez-faire models that dominated the field during the early twentieth century. Ely was charged with teaching subversive doctrine in 1894, a discussion of corporate abuses and trust policy in the country, and investigated by the University's Board of Regents. Eventually vindicated, Ely quickly became a champion and symbol for academic freedom and the University of Wisconsin. </p><p>Willing to talk about Marxism and Socialism at the turn of the century, Ely made many notable friends in progressive circles such as Bob LaFollette, Sr., and Theodore Roosevelt; and his house became an open meeting place for established reformists. At the time of Ely's death, the New York Times described him as ""the dean of American economics."" Married twice, Ely had many children, some of whom would also settle with their families in University Heights. Since the Ely family departed their house in 1958 it has been occupied Edwin Taylor, a professor at the university, and the Barash family, two clinical doctors who work at the University of Wisconsin Hospital.</p><p>The overall appearance and style of the house is odd in light of Ely's character, associations, and supposed taste. Since he is known to have had a large role in the design and construction of the house, and he chose a Chicago architect with a progressive reputation, the traditional, if not out of fashion, Georgian Revival style seems an odd choice. </p><p>Ely was vocally critical of traditional building designs on the University campus and of choosing architects and styles with little relation to Wisconsin or progressive associations. Yet he picked exactly those same features for his own large home. </p>",img/uHeights/ely.png,Rowan Davidson
Fett House,43.069478,-89.415251,1711 Van Hise Avenue,"<p>The George Fett house is one of the largest bungalow homes in Madison and an excellent example of the style. While there is neither a known architect or designer nor any records of the building's construction, elements of the house reveal the influence of Arts and Crafts and Prairie-style design sensibilities. The one-and-one-half-story house is principally low, horizontal, and massive with large brick piers on the broad, sweeping porch that refers to the Bungalow styles of the Craftsman magazine. Typical of the style and period, the Fett House utilizes fine materials and unostentatious details through stained glass windows in simple geometric patterns, stucco siding, and dark stained wood trim throughout. </p><p>The original owner, George Fett, was the corporate secretary for the Madison-based Menges Pharmacy Company and a pharmacist by profession. His workplace and pharmacy were located just on the other side of the neighborhood at 901 University Avenue.  Fett moved his family to the house at 1711 Van Hise when he assumed the manager's position; they had previously lived elsewhere in the neighborhood at 45 Lathrop Street. The subsequent owner, Gustavs Martinsons, worked as a project architect with Flad and Associates in Madison for much of the post-World War II period.</p><p>The Fetts's pattern of movement is typical for residents of the neighborhood. Many University Heights residents tended to purchase smaller homes on the periphery at first, and then moved into larger, more expensive homes in the district as their families and careers changed to allow it. This was and is especially common among members of the UW-Madison faculty. Even for those not involved with the University, the neighborhood could support changing needs, interests, and aspirations.</p>",img/uHeights/Fett.png,Rowan Davidson
Gilmore House ,43.07079,-89.4185, 120 Ely Place ,"<p>The Eugene Gilmore House, located at the highest point in University Heights and offering panoramic views of the University campus and the State Capitol, was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The house is an excellent example of Prairie Style architecture, it is intentionally united with its advantageous site, and displays several hallmark features of the style: strong horizontal lines, extended walls, sweeping eaves, and banded windows. Given its location and form, the residence has been nicknamed the Airplane House.""</p><p>The wings that give the composition its aeronautical name spread out from a T-shaped plan with an obscured entrance below grade on the first floor. Most of the living spaces are on the second floor to take advantage of the views and the privacy gained from being set farther away from the street and neighbors. </p><p>Typical of Wright's work, the decoration is limited to geometric leaded glass patterns set in banded casement windows across private and public interior spaces. A copper batten-seam roof, very expensive at the time, covers both wings that extend outward from the forward-facing central pavilion and its triangular balconies at each end. </p><p>Eugene Gilmore, one of Wright's more famous and influential clients, came to Madison in 1902 with his wife, Blanche, from a successful Boston law firm to join the faculty at the University of Wisconsin's law school. He quickly rose up the administrative ladder and became famous for his many reformist ideas, efficiency, and organizational skills that would later lead to his appointment as the Vice-Governor of the Philippines in 1922. He returned to the United States and academia, becoming dean of the University of Iowa law school, and president of the same university in 1934. </p><p>After Gilmore left Madison he transferred ownership of the house to Kenneth Parsons, another University of Wisconsin professor. </p><p>The Gilmores had purchased the difficult and prominent lot for their future home on the advice of their soon-to-be neighbor, Richard Ely. They chose Wright as their architect after seeing his work in an early 1908 Architectural Record article.</p><p> Wright's designs were increasingly popular at the time, and they also carried the connotations of a uniquely American, if not Midwestern, architecture and progressive ideals. The house had a large budget of $8,000, but went over the amount by an additional $2,000 due to trouble finding a carpenter willing to take on the project because of the unusual framing details. </p><p>Gilmore ended up supervising the construction himself since Wright conducted the design and supervision in absentia. In 1929 the house was significantly altered to make room for a three-car garage in the back and by making adjustments to the difficult entry. The work was executed by the local Madison architecture firm of Law, Law, and Potter and matches the materials and methods of the original design, if not the spirit.</p>",img/uHeights/gilmore.png,Rowan Davidson
Morehouse House ,43.07099,-89.41764, 101 Ely Place ,"<p>Towards the end of the construction in University Heights, a few modern styles were introduced into the neighborhood. In 1936, Edward and Anna Morehouse contracted the architects Keck and Keck to design and build a home in the International Style, explicitly drawing influences from European design trends. Located in view of the Gilmore, Ely, and Buell houses, the Morehouse residence surprised onlookers with its bold appearance. </p><p>Largely unaltered since its construction in 1936, the house emphasizes simple geometric volumes and the application of thin skin-like surfaces over a light structural frame. The two-story house, set into the hillside that slopes down Summit Avenue from Ely Place, is arranged with four bedrooms similar to later walk-out designs, so that each floor, including the basement, has livable spaces with full access to the exterior. </p><p>The exterior walls of the basic white cube, punctured by vertical ribbons of windows with frames painted a dark brown to contrast with the light stucco exterior, create the effect of an intentionally asymmetrical abstract composition.  The windows are grouped closely at the corners for a visual effect that results in a re-entrant corner detail, which foreshadows a common Modernist design element that would be seen later in the apartments and office towers of Mies Van Der Rohe. </p><p>Despite these innovations, the house still utilized such common building practices as wood stud balloon frame construction, fine finishes, and walls of stucco on the exterior and plaster on the interior over metal lath. The overall design was also comprehensive, given the casework, original furniture, and light fixtures were all designed by Keck and Keck.</p><p>Edward Morehouse's reputation was as a progressive, if not radical, thinker at the time. Serving as both a Wisconsin Public Service Commission economist and Professor of Economics at the University, Morehouse came to live with his family in University Heights by way of familial connections. His wife, Anna, was the daughter of the prominent and influential economist Richard Ely from Ely's first marriage. </p><p>Ely lived only a few houses away and was instrumental in bringing the Morehouses to live in Madison and work for the state. Likewise, Anna attended the University of Wisconsin along with her good friend Catherine, who would later become George Keck's wife. </p><p>Subsequent occupants of the house, the Alberty and Olsen families, have also been employed as faculty at the University of Wisconsin.Born in Watertown, Wisconsin, George Keck worked as an engineer and tried his hand at abstract painting before settling on the profession of architecture in Chicago during the 1920s. His brother, William, joined him shortly and their firm became known for producing high-quality modern designs explicitly influenced by the Bauhaus School. </p><p>Their work was typically not as severe and mechanistic as many European examples and reveals distinctly American sensibilities in the Morehouse house, including organic and Wrightian influences and the attention given to siting considerations. This latter feature became even more apparent as the limited passive solar design elements found in the Morehouse house were stressed in later Keck and Keck work. </p>",img/uHeights/morehouse.png,Rowan Davidson
Morris House ,43.07035,-89.4174, 1815 Summit Avenue ,"<p>The Morris House stands near the highest point in University Heights, where Ely Place intersects with Summit Avenue. Like a number of other houses in the area, the Morris House can broadly be considered a Prairie style design. The architect, Alvan Small, had a reputation for this kind of design and, along with architects Claude and Starck, can be considered a pioneer in Madison's version of the style. </p><p>The house displays primarily a stucco exterior with brick elements at either end of the long building, both at the entrance and porch and garage. Occasional groupings of leaded glass windows and wood banding emphasize the house's length and horizontal design. Consistent proportions, siting, and the use of similar design elements in simple ways to produce individualized work for clients typify Small's work. </p><p>Other similar houses designed by Small in University Heights include the Allen House at 2014 Chamberlain Avenue, the Haen House at 2017 Kendall Avenue, the Johnson House at 1713 Chadbourne Avenue, and the Jones House at 1717 Summit Avenue. </p><p>Small's Prairie style homes were variations on a theme: they almost always displayed a simple two-story rectangular box with side gables and stucco walls. These houses would typically have overhanging eaves, grouped windows, simple wood trim, and Craftsman interior details. Comparing the Morris House to the Whitson House, designed by Claude and Starck, reveals similarities within Madison's architectural community at the time.</p><p>Thomas Morris, the original owner, was a successful and prominent Madison businessman with close connections to the University of Wisconsin. It was perhaps these connections, a large faculty population and proximity to campus, that drew him and his family to University Heights.</p><p> The popularity of the Craftsman magazine also helped to disseminate many of the design philosophies and aesthetic tastes that became commonplace in University Heights, and it is likely that some of the work of designers like Small was brought to the attention of the Morris family in this way. Later inhabitants of the Morris House have included Cyrus MacDuffee, a university professor, and his family.</p><p>Born and educated in Madison, Small had experience in Sullivan's office as well as in collaborations with Connover and Porter and other Madison-based architects. Small had his own firm after 1907, and later in life he partnered with another influential Madison architect, John Flad. </p><p>The development of Madison's version of the prairie style was a group project, in which Small played a key part.</p>",img/uHeights/morris.png,Rowan Davidson
Randall School ,43.067871,-89.417025, 1802 Regent Street ,"<p>Randall School, located on busy Regent Street at the southern edge of University Heights, was built shortly after the City of Madison annexed the area, and brought utilities and services, such as the school, to the new neighborhood. The original section, which can still be seen in the central three bays of the Spooner Street facade, was designed by Madison architect Alvan E. Small, then working in the office of Conover and Porter Architects.</p><p> The school was built to handle the growing school-age population of children who belonged to the educated and affluent families of the quickly growing neighborhood. The school displays a modified Tudor revival style with traces of the increasingly popular Prairie style, which are visible in its non-historicist ornament as well as the bands of windows clearly arranged into the distinctive classroom bays on each floor of the structure. </p><p>The school dates from a period in Madison history that saw rapid expansion of the city to the west and east and the expansion of its municipal government, including the Madison School District. Half of the block along Regent Street that had not yet been purchased was set aside for the school in the initial plat of University Heights.</p><p> Following the school's completion the adjacent playing fields on the same block were donated in 1907 by Burr Jones, a prominent Madison attorney and original partner in the University Heights Company. They were named Olive Jones Field in memory of his recently deceased daughter. Later additions to the school faithfully followed the spirit and architectural language of the original design. </p><p>The first addition occurred at the north end in 1912, followed by the south end in 1925. Randall is also the oldest continuously operating school in Madison.</p>",img/uHeights/randall.png,Rowan Davidson
Sellery House ,43.069532,-89.420079, 2021 Van Hise Avenue ,"<p>The Sellery House is an unusual and derivative design that blends elements from the Egyptian Revival and Prairie styles. The overall composition is almost identical to a 1907 house designed by George Maher, a successful Prairie Style architect, for Henry Schultz in Winnetka, Illinois. </p><p>While Maher had a working relationship with a number of Madison-based architects, none of them was responsible for the work done on behalf of the Sellery family. Instead, the house may have been designed by the Chicago firm of Murphy and Cloyes. The design lacks some of the detail in scale and proportion that is exhibited in many of the other Prairie Style homes in the area.</p><p>Although little is known about the architect, a great deal is known about the original owner and occupant. George Sellery commissioned the house in 1910, the same year he was named Dean of the College of Letters and Science at the University of Wisconsin. He had previously spent ten years as a professor of European history at the University, having arrived in Madison directly from his graduate studies. </p><p>The family moved to University Heights because of Sellery's new position and the young family's need for a larger home. Sellery served as Dean of the College of Letters and Science until 1942, when he retired after decades of influential service and teaching. </p><p>He also served briefly as the acting President of the University in 1937 and had a profound impact on the University as an institution. A number of streets, buildings, and organizations around the University and Madison still carry his name. He lived at the same address until his death in 1962; the house was sold following the death of his wife, Beatrice, four years later.</p>",img/uHeights/sellery.png,Rowan Davidson
Terrace Homes Apartments ,43.070026,-89.413925,114-118 North Breese Terrace ,"<p>Terrace Homes apartments at the corner of Breese Terrace and Hoyt Avenue, designed by architect Philip Homer for the contractors and realtors Paul E. Stark and John Findorff and Sons, was built in 1927 as a cooperative apartment. Although similar to the condominium models popular in America's larger cities during the 1920s, it is likely the only apartment building of its type in Madison of the era.</p><p> However, it took some time for this ownership model to be adopted since the impact of the Great Depression, which occurred shortly after the building's completion, kept a large number of its units empty until the post-World War II years. The high value of the property and its ownership requirements meant that the Terrace Construction Company held five units, in lieu of payment for work completed, until 1938. </p><p> By 1945 a majority of the shares in the cooperative were owned by residents and ownership was transferred to the organization, which still exists today. The success of cooperative living models elsewhere brought the idea to the attention of developers Stark and Findorff, who were eager to introduce the often luxurious and urban approach to a rapidly growing Madison. </p><p>The architect, Homer, had recently visited the newly completed large-scale condominiums at Jackson Park on the south side of Chicago and witnessed the extensive demand for such units. The site along Breese Terrace, snuggled between the wealthy homes of University Heights and the hustle and bustle of the campus and Camp Randall along a street car line, likely seemed a good location. </p><p>The building, with the exception of some adjustments and additions to accommodate fire codes and modern utilities, closely resembles its original form. Its design clearly embraces the eclectic neo-Tudor and modified English style popular in the 1920s as evidenced by its allusions to the taste and stability of manor houses in England. The exterior of the masonry structure is clad in brick with tile accents and rough stone headers, lintels, and frames; the building carries the Tudor design through the exterior with the exception of the rear recesses, which, for economic reasons, were left in unadorned brick. </p><p>The exterior also has notable decorative parapets, stone banding, asbestos-shingled projections over exterior doors, and varied and highly elaborate chimneys that slim as they rise vertically up the length of the building. Each chimney is shaped as a polygon with variegated brick designs. The leaded glass windows, which still exist today, are visible on all of the exterior street-facing facades, while the rear windows for kitchens, bathrooms, and service elements have simple double-hung glazing. </p><p>Because of the socio-economic status of the residents and the expense of the cooperative units, the apartments also used the recently developed Stephens System of soundproofing. This system, which had the floor joists resting on cushioned steel saddles, allowed the space between the concrete and wood floors to be filled with sound-dampening insulation.</p><p>Local Madison architect Philip Homer designed the building for Stark and Findorff; Homer then proceeded to live there with his wife, Gladys, until his death decades later. Born in LaCrosse and from 1912 on a lifelong Madisonian, Homer worked during the 1920s as the chief architect for the Stark Land Company and Capital Construction Company, both owned by Paul Stark. Homer was also responsible for the design of Schenk's Department Store on Atwood Avenue and the Mifflin Arcade on Mifflin Street. </p><p>While usually successful, Homer was forced to work as an automobile salesman during the lean years of the 1930s before returning to private architectural practice after World War II. Like a number of the original occupants, the middle-class Homers, with their small family, remained in the building for a long time.  It has always had thirteen units, twelve for owners/tenants and one for the building superintendent. </p><p>The professions and occupations of the residents have varied greatly, ranging from professionals such as engineers, architects, and dentists, to others in the trades and services, including salespeople, firefighters, and a university facilities janitor. Generally, the units have provided residents with a stable, comfortable, and private living environment; these same provisions and preferences are similar to the majority of University Heights residents, although they are not necessarily in keeping with tenant conditions along Breese Terrace. </p>",img/uHeights/terrace.png,Rowan Davidson
Whitson House ,43.07191,-89.41952,1920 Arlington Place ,"<p>In 1905, Andrew Whitson, a Professor of Soils at the University of Wisconsin, contracted the Madison architectural firm of Claude and Starck to design and build his house. The University Heights neighborhood, well established by this time, was a focal point for progressive residential architectural styles in the period, and Claude and Starck were active in this development. </p><p>Although Wilson's house clearly shows aspects of Gothic and Tudor revival influences, a number of more modern stylistic features are also apparent. The house has stucco siding with painted wood trim banding and a wood belt course that separates the two stories. Many of the windows are grouped together in asymmetrical elevations. The windows in the stairwell off the main entrance are polygons, a feature that would be repeated many times in other Claude and Starck designs.</p><p>Along with the vaguely Arts and Crafts approach, the house has a degree of simplicity, attention to its site, and horizontality that foreshadow the Prairie School then becoming popular. Indeed, Claude and Starck were among Madison's most prolific Prairie School practitioners. </p><p>The faculty and professionals living in University Heights saw themselves as making a statement about their position and concerns by hiring architects such as Claude and Starck to design their stylish homes. Since that time the neighborhood's occupants have not changed greatly; Peter Morrison, a university professor, lived in the house after the Whitsons. </p><p>The Whitson house represents the first in a long string of very similar designs by Claude and Starck in Madison. A number are in University Heights, some quite close to the Whitson House, including the Steven House at 1908 Arlington Place, the Meyer House at 1937 Arlington Place, and the Pence House at the end of the same block. All of these homes were commissioned and built over a ten-year span from 1904 to 1914. </p><p>During the preceding decade both Louis Claude and Edward Starck spent some time working and learning their profession in Chicago, where they collaborated with the offices of George Maher and Louis Sullivan. Certainly some direct influence of Maher's architecture can be detected in their Madison designs; however, the development of their particular version of the Prairie Style appears to be one of cross-currents since they developed a unique approach of mixing Gothic touches with typical Prairie design elements and motifs that others across the region would follow. </p>",img/uHeights/whiston.png,Rowan Davidson
Buell House  ,43.07126,-89.41821,115 Ely Place ,"<p>The first residence erected in University Heights was the massive Queen Anne-style Buell House. Designed by the prominent local architecture firm of Conover and Porter, the design has strong references to the popular shingle style and the Richardson Romanesque. The two-and-one-half story building, with dark red shingles covering much of its exterior and a rusticated smooth stone foundation, has a vertical emphasis. It is adorned with extensive Victorian details in a number of bays, dormers, and turrets. </p><p>The roof has an open gable on the central element of the house, while the rest of the roof is hipped with a tower at the northern corner. The Queen Anne style in this case serves as a transition between the overwrought Victorian mansions preceding it and the shingle and more subdued progressive styles increasing in popularity at the time. The house has curved g brackets and intricate wood detailing throughout that do not reference any specific historical precedent.</p><p> A number of the windows have leaded glass that, again, does not reference a previous style and there is a lack of classical ornamentation and proportions. The interior has a large, centrally located living space that flows into other rooms from a central hall. The first floor also has a massive staircase with a central fireplace and large gothic windows that light both the stairs and the living area. </p><p>The Buell family built their home near the top of the hill in 1894, before any other properties in the neighborhood had been developed. The size of the house, along with the slow development of the neighborhood, made the house stand out, and in contemporary photographs it looks distinctly forlorn. Its solitary and conspicuous nature led the imposing structure to be dubbed by locals as Buell's Folly."" However,  when Charles Buell died in 1938 his home was surrounded by the largest and most desirable homes of Madison's elite. </p><p>In fact, Buell, a member of the original University Heights Company and something of a land speculator, ended up selling much of the property to nearby residents as the neighborhood grew in size and popularity. </p><p>Charles Buell is notable because he was the only head of a household not directly connected with the university who lived in the Heights during the first decade of its existence.</p><p> As a prominent and wealthy attorney with the Smith and Buell office in Madison, he had influence and standing in the community, but did not fit the mold of residents in the neighborhood. After Charles's death the house was passed to his daughter, Mary, and from her to Carroll Sweet, a Forest Products Laboratory Engineer, and his wife Pauline. Van Potter, a well-regarded university professor, lived in the house until recently. </p><p>The Buells contracted the Conover and Porter firm to design their home. Conover and Porter were known during their time for working in a style not unlike H.H. Richardson. The fortress-like University of Wisconsin Armory, which the firm designed around the same time, is an excellent example of their style. </p><p>The prolific partnership of Conover and Porter frequently used arches, earth tones, and massive stonework that echoed the Richardson Romanesque revival. Their detailing, in both residential and institutional work, was typically beautiful and well-handled and had the unusual trait of adding gothic elements to otherwise Queen Anne style designs.<p>",img/uHeights/buell.png,Rowan Davidson
Simms Place,43.11001,-89.354911,2231 Myrtle St,"<p>Simm's Place has been operating as a bar/restaurant since 1972. Prior to this, the building housed a service station. Jeannie Simmons, the owner of the bar, lives next door in a small Cape Cod house that was orphaned from the Eken Park neighborhood when Packers Avenue was moved eastward from the west side of Simm's Place to its current location during the mid-1960s. Despite its seeming distance from a residential neighborhood, Simm's functions as a neighborhood bar, with its customer base coming largely from Kraft/Oscar Mayer foods.</p><p>Simmons opened the bar with her husband, Maynard, in 1972. He worked for Oscar Mayer for twenty-seven years, driving a semi-trailer around the country prior to his death in 1994.  </p><p>The couple owned several lots along Packers Avenue when it was relocated. Initially they rented parking stalls out to Oscar's, but gradually sold some of the lots while retaining the house and bar. Oscar Mayer/Kraft has asked Simmons several times to sell, but she has remained steadfast in refusing this, and has continued to operate the bar and occupy her home for forty years. </p><p>Most of Simm's customers work for Oscar Mayer; this camaraderie creates its neighborhood character.  Simmons claims 95% of her customers work at Oscar's, though not the corporate staff who are discouraged from attending. The Simm's family is close. </p><p>One bartender/waitress has been there for thirty years and family members and friends help out at the bar. Simmons described the culture of the bar on the occasion of its 35th anniversary:  ""They're family. I don't know what I'd do without these people. I've been there so long, just about 75% of them call me Mom.'""</p><p>Simmons no longer works ""second shift, though the bar is open long hours to serve the different shifts at the plant. The bar has sponsored a baseball team, and has numerous games and event nights. </p>",img/eken/simms.png,Chad Inman and Anna Andrzejewski
Eken Park,43.10874,-89.3475,Coolidge Street,"<p>The Eken Park neighborhood is located on Madison's near east side; it is bounded by East Washington Avenue, Packers Avenue, North Street and Aberg Avenue. Although the neighborhood developed in multiple stages beginning in the early twentieth century, the tour focuses on the north side of Coolidge Street that abuts the two-acre Eken Park.</p><p> This part of the neighborhood was developed during the 1940s, and today represents a remarkably preserved example of a World War II-era mass-produced housing development (a very early example of a type of development that would proliferate in the post-World War years). This sort of development pattern is rare in Madison, but the presence of such a neighborhood shows that it existed here as elsewhere in the country during World War II and its immediate aftermath. </p><p>The Coolidge Street section also shows the close proximity of home and work during the mid-twentieth century, as it was developed to support industries on Madison's east side, including Oscar Mayer.</p><p>The neighborhood is named for one of the first landholders/farmers in this part of Madison, Iver Eken, who purchased the land that would become Eken Park in 1888. The Eken farm was passed down through several generations of the Eken family until Iver's descendants began subdividing parcels for development during the 1920s. </p><p>The Eken family continued to reside in the farmhouse, a heavily remodeled structure located at the southwestern corner of Eken Park near the intersection of Mayer Avenue and Dexter, until 1947 when Olena Eken (Iver's daughter) passed away. The land that would become the neighborhood greenspace, Eken Park, was donated to the City of Madison by Selma Eken before her death in 1940.</p>",img/eken/ekenpark.png,"Anna Andrzejewski (with Nate Millington, Alyssa O'Connor, Ellisha Boschuetz, Nick Woboril, and Joel Pachefsky)"
Oscar Mayer,43.107394,-89.35537,910 Mayer Ave,"<p>Oscar Mayer (now part of Kraft Foods) has been in business at its Madison location since 1919, when Oscar Mayer, Jr., purchased a defunct meatpacking cooperative formerly operating at this site. Much of what is on the grounds today dates to the second half of the twentieth century, but the site is important to Madison's history as well as the east side landscape we will see on the tour. Oscars, as it is still referred to locally, was Madison's largest employer during parts of the twentieth century. Generally the company has had a good relationship with its employees and the surrounding community, though several labor strikes are also notable.</p><p>Oscar Mayer, Sr. immigrated to the United States from Bavaria in 1873 at the age of fourteen. He spent three years in Detroit working as a butcher boy before moving to Chicago in 1876. Mayer continued to work in the meat industry, including  the Chicago stockyards of the venerable Armour and Company for six years as well as at local butcher shops. </p><p>By 1880, Mayer had decided to found his own business, and wrote to his brother, Gottfried, in Germany, to join him in this enterprise. Gottfried had established himself in Nuremberg as a wurstmaker.  When he joined Oscar in Chicago in 1883, the two were immediately able to establish a successful butcher shop in leased space in the Kolling Meat Market in a German neighborhood on Chicago's near north side in 1883. </p><p>By 1888, when their lease expired, the business was thriving, so much so that the pair took out a $10,000 loan to build their own shop, with living quarters above, two blocks away. With the help of Max, a younger brother who acted as bookkeeper, the business thrived, with Gottfried overseeing production and Oscar managing the overall operation. </p><p>The Oscar Mayer Company has long prided itself on good relationships between ownership, management, and labor, as well as with the broader public they serve. This could arguably extend back to 1893, when Oscar Mayer, Sr. sponsored the German Pavilion at the Colombian Exposition, or to when, in 1906, the company voluntarily joined the newly created federal meat inspection program. </p><p>It continued into the 1930s, when the company distributed free meat to unemployed and homeless residents on the north side of Chicago. The company has attempted to be on the forefront of best practices in packaging and meat handling, and also of hiring and employee benefit packages, including educational programs for the children of employees. </p><p>Although most employees spoke (and speak) fondly of their employment at Oscar's, the company has seen its share of labor strife, particularly during the 1930s when the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Local 538 organized in retaliation for lower wages, longer work hours, and favoritism. The first union meeting occurred during the summer of 1933, but growth was slow, as members foresaw no action for their dues.</p><p> A strike vote was taken in May 1934, with only 51 percent of the members supporting a walkout. After the national union told the Madison local to stay on the job, several members walked out anyway, a bold move, but one that led to a re-negotiation of terms between management and labor within twenty-four hours. The company immediately recognized the union, and no major labor stoppages occurred after this; it was path-breaking for Madison's unions and indeed, preceded the Wagner Act's passage by a year. </p><p>In addition to employing thousands of Madisonians, the company also benefitted the broader community, in part through their charitable foundation, but also through financial incentives in housing and transportation that benefited workers as well as others on Madison's north side. </p><p>As David Mollenhoff has documented in his book on Madison's history, the city experienced a housing slump after World War I; rather than see their employees struggle, Oscar's stepped in to oversee construction of fifty affordable houses for their workers on Madison's east side. The company also paid the private streetcar line to expand to the north side of Madison, thereby providing workers with easy access to their new facility. </p>",img/eken/oscarmyr.png,Anna Andrzejewski
Harlow S. & Isabelle C. Ott House,43.07788,-89.3699,807 Jenifer Street,"<p>The Harlow S. and Isabelle C. Ott House is a late Victorian house with Queen Anne characteristics and Arts and Crafts leaded glass, oak paneling, and English Gothic details. It was designed and built in 1897-1898 by the young Madison architectural firm of Claude & Starck, who had only formed their architectural partnership in 1896. </p><p>The house at 807 Jenifer Street was built for Harlow Sherman and Isabelle C. Ott on the former side yard of the adjacent Holver Gabriel house (see entry). The unusual triangular lot posed a unique design challenge for the architects. They chose to orient the house toward the corner, so that it faced neither Jenifer nor Spaight Streets.</p><p> In the manner of designing an ""organic"" floor plan, akin to those espoused by their progressive peers in the Chicago School of architecture (later the Prairie School), they aligned the ""living rooms"" along the Spaight Street side and front end of the house. The front of the house was given a rounded room that provided a large turret with a conical roof. This feature, along with a steep roof, attic dormers with peaked gables, Gothic detailing on the porch, and some aspects of the interior, combined to provide a variation on the Queen Anne that had with roots in Shingle Style forms, and aspects of the English Gothic style.</p><p> It was the first house in the neighborhood designed by Claude & Starck and only the second or third oldest known house they designed in Madison. Over the following two decades Claude & Starck built many more houses along Spaight Street and Orton Park.</p><p>The present owner purchased the house in 1997, reopened it as a single- family home, and restored the badly deteriorated exterior. Fortunately, the ground floor remained protected and still exhibits its grand staircase with a tall oriel that extends toward Jenifer Street. It is believed that the oriel was intended to serve as a lookout for Isabelle Ott as she watched for approaching streetcars during inclement weather.</p><p> Especially notable are the simple English patterns of leaded glass situated above the bench and in the oriel window of the stair landing windows. The foyer walls are clad with horizontal battens and narrow beaded strips are also seen in houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1893. The airlock at the front door entrance and the stair wainscoting reveal two original Lincrusta patterns. </p><p>Another non-viewable aspect is the somewhat higher level of finish displayed in the original third-floor maid's room. It is of quarter-sawn white oak trim and has a dormer oriented to the lake. These features were employed by progressive architects in an effort to embrace the hired help, rather than set them entirely apart. </p><p>The yard originally was at least partly enclosed with a low woven-wire fence that included Gothic finials on its short posts. Today's garden is referred to by the owner as a pleasant collision of Japanese and English Cottage styled gardens. </p><p>The house is currently in the process of further restoration.</p>",img/TLR/harlow-ott.png,Gary Tipler
Orton Park,43.08069,-89.364379,Spaight and Ingersoll Streets,"<p>Orton Park, a three and one half acre park that comprises all of block 180 in the original 1836 city plat of Madison, was the city's first public park. Prior to 1877, the block served as the site for Madison's first public cemetery. The cemetery was dedicated following incorporation of the village in 1846. By the time Madison became a city in 1857, additional space was needed, and thus land on Madison's west side, which would become Forest Hill Cemetery, was acquired for this purpose.</p><p> In 1877, the bodies buried at Orton Park were exhumed and reinterred in Forest Hill. After this, prominent residents of Third Lake Ridge, notably George Ott (see Ott House entry), lobbied the city for a public park. In 1879 Ott raised $100 in individual private subscriptions to convert the block into public space. Orton Park was dedicated in 1883, and was named after a former mayor and then Supreme Court Justice, Harlow S. Orton; it officially opened in 1887. An observer for the Wisconsin State Journal noted, ""From 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered under the boughs despite the cool atmosphere and all seemed greatly please with the free entertainment provided.""</p><p>After the park became a desirable neighborhood amenity, wealthier residents of Third Lake Ridge built houses facing the park on all sides; some were fashionable examples by some of Madison's most well known late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century architects, including Claude and Starck. Prairie and craftsman style houses stand alongside Queen Anne examples, although the mixing of these styles is common as well.</p><p>The park has been a central gathering place for Third Lake Ridge ever since 1883. Band concerts were held there during the 1880s and 1890s, and farmers markets and socials have been held at Orton for the past century.</p><p> It has been the site of the annual Orton Park festival for many decades. The gazebo was constructed in 1979 by Stuart Gallaher. George Segal's sculpture, ""Gay Liberation"", was installed for a time beginning in 1986 in the Park. </p><p>Orton Park became a local landmark in 1975 and the Orton Park Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.</p>",img/TLR/orton.png,Anna Andrzejewski
John George Ott House,43.07775,-89.37121,754 Jenifer Street,"<p>The large imposing house at 754 Jenifer Street was built for John George Ott in 1873. Originally designed as an Italianate Villa, the house received significant Victorian ornamentation over time. The house is of frame construction sheathed in brick veneer. The main section is two-and-one-half stories tall; the wings are two stories in height.</p><p> A distinctive feature of the house is provided by its windows on the main section; they generally have stone sills with ornately carved lintels. The lintels are arched on the first floor and incised onto the upper story, and while an attempt was made at consistency, differences can be found between windows. Sometime between 1873 and 1892 two additions were made to the original block. One addition on the northeastern side has a side gabled roof and a porch. </p><p>The porch contains two doors, one of which was boarded up and is now being used as a window. Another addition, facing west, was added between 1902 and 1908. There have been other changes as the property has transformed into a multi-unit residence, mainly having to do with porch changes. A cupola once stood atop the main section. </p><p> John George Ott was a successful entrepreneur in Madison during its early decades and the house is a testament to the wealth that businessmen like Ott attained. Ott was a German-Swiss Immigrant who came to Madison in 1850 when he was twenty-three years old. He owned a brickyard on this property; the bricks for the house were likely made here.</p><p> Ott also established a grocery store along nearby Williamson Street near the corner with Livingston (just down the street from his house), and eventually he went into the insurance business. </p><p>The house may be compared in its grandeur to others in the vicinity that date to this era, such as the Holver Gabriel House. In its scale and Italianate features, it certainly draws on popular styles of the time seen in pattern books. Yet its construction of locally produced red bricks (rather than the then-faddish Milwaukee cream city bricks) and its unusual lintels suggest a desire on the part of the owner to create a distinctive house and not just another elite mansion.</p><p>Ott was a prominent figure in Third Lake Ridge. He was very active in civic affairs; he served on the Madison City Council and Dane County Board. He founded several notable clubs, including the German Masonic Lodge, the Turnevein, and the Maennerchoir. </p><p>Ott also lobbied for the conversion of the former public graveyard site down the street into a public park. He lived at this house until the time of his death. His son, Harlow S. Ott, became a successful pharmacist, and built a house across the street from his parents during the late 1890s. </p><p>Following Ott's death his daughter, Alma, lived with her husband, Frederick Lacher, in the house. Like many other large houses in the neighborhood, it has since become a multi-unit rental property. The house is a Madison Landmark and a contributing element to the Third Lake Ridge landmark district.</p>",img/TLR/georgeott.png,"Michelle Oyen, Erin Kauppinen, Andrew Baird, and James Wright"
Kleuter Wholesale Grocery Warehouse,43.082361,-89.373158,901 East Washington Avenue,"<p>Towering high above the commercial and industrial buildings nearby, the five-story structure at 901 East Washington Avenue was originally a grocery warehouse. The red brick and reinforced concrete construction materials provided not only a fireproof building, but also the structural strength needed for a tall, spacious warehouse. Abundant large windows provided efficient light for the work and storage areas throughout. The structure was built by the Wisconsin Construction Company of Madison for $55,000. </p><p>The subtle Prairie-style accents and proportions distinguish this building from the more utilitarian and simply-finished warehouses and workshops located nearby. One of the structure's defining features are the three square towers, each decorated with geometric ornamental designs within the parapet. The use of horizontal raised-brick banding on the first and fifth levels, and raised-brick quoins on the square towers, further emphasizes the building's Prairie-style influence. </p><p>The Kleuter Wholesale Company chose noted Madison-based Prairie style architect Alvan Small to design their new building. Small began his apprenticeship in 1887 with the notable Madison firm, Conover & Porter; spent a year in Chicago in the office of Louis Sullivan; and then returned to Madison in 1900. </p><p>He practiced for twenty-five years before retiring in 1926. Several Madison structures designed by Small are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, but the Kleuter Wholesale Grocery Warehouse (deemed eligible in 2002) is considered one of Small's non-residential structures influenced by the Prairie style. The Olds Seed Company Building is another example of Small's non-residential work.</p><p>Industry and development flourished on Madison's near East Side and the Kleuter Wholesale Company, like other businesses in Third Lake Ridge, took advantage of the proximity to rail lines for their grocery wholesale firm. They had operated their warehouse on East Wilson Street since about 1868, but by 1915, needed additional space. The Kleuter Brothers sold Badger Brand canned goods, among other items.</p><p> In 1927 Jerry and Emanuel Simon purchased the business and warehouse building, at which time it became known as Simon Brothers Wholesale Groceries. The Simon Brothers switched to liquor distribution in 1935, a little over a year after Prohibition ended, and utilized the warehouse until 1979. </p><p>The building was most recently occupied by the Mautz Paint Company, a local firm that got its start in 1892 as a paint and wallpaper store. Following years of hard work and the manufacture of their paint products, Mautz relocated to 939 East Washington Avenue in 1942, just east of the Kleuter warehouse. Mautz purchased the former warehouse from the Simon Brothers Company in 1979 to boost production and add warehouse space. </p><p>By 1985, Mautz was producing 1.3 million gallons of paint a year and by 2000 their annual sales totaled nearly $33 million. In November 2001, the Sherwin-Williams Co. purchased the Mautz brand, its formula, and its thirty three stores. The former Kleuter Warehouse Building, however, was not part of the transaction, and is currently for sale. Its location on the East Washington corridor makes it a prime candidate for adaptive reuse, and several proposals are under consideration.</p>",img/TLR/kleuter.png,Mark Speltz
Fauerbach House,43.079079,-89.366686,940 Spaight Street,"<p>The Fauerbach House, a Greek Revival side-passage frame dwelling built in 1856, represents a common form and  popular style in Third Lake Ridge during the first few decades of development. Its history shows the path of assimilation of a prominent German family, the Fauerbachs, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as well as the changing uses of dwellings such as this in the neighborhood. Although its basic form is readable today, the house has undergone many changes that make its interpretation difficult on the basis of the built fabric alone.</p><p>The Fauerbach House was built by Erastus Wyman, a Yankee carpenter from New York. Initially a carpenter, Wyman eventually went into business and opened a lumberyard. Wyman's relative affluence is suggested by the stylish attributes of the house as well as its location within a cluster of homes of wealthy early Madisonians; next door stood the imposing Shipley-Shuttleworth House and across the street was Farwell's Octagon House (now demolished). </p><p>The front-facing gable, intact cornice returns, and symmetrical placement of the windows (with the exception of the replaced picture window on the first floor) are hallmarks of the Greek Revival style. Interior elements, such as the original newel post and door casings in the front passage and elsewhere in the house, also suggest the original owner's affluence. It is also possible that the house had a one-story colonnaded entry porch. Recent renovations revealed that the frame house originally had brick nogging. </p><p>Henry Fauerbach, part owner of the Fauerbach Brewery, purchased the house in 1890. One of the city's oldest and most successful breweries, Fauerbach Brewery was started in 1868 by Henry's father, Peter, an immigrant from Fauerbach, Germany. He initially leased the Sprecher Brewery building and eventually purchased it in 1878. </p><p>Peter and his wife, Maria, had six sons: Louis, Philip, Henry, Charles, Emil, and William. Upon Peter's death in 1886, Maria ran the business for five years until 1891. At that point, the four oldest children assumed company leadership, with Charles eventually going into other occupations outside of the brewery and Emil entering the business when he became old enough.</p><p> Under the leadership of this second generation of Fauerbachs, the brewery would experience levels of growth that Peter could never have imagined. In 1878, after running the business for ten years, the brewery had the capacity to produce 1,500 barrels of beer per year. By 1907 Fauerbach Brewing Co. had twenty cellar tanks, each with the capacity to hold 240 barrels of beer for a total of 4,800 barrels of beer at one time. </p><p>Prohibition and the Great Depression dealt a severe blow to the Fauerbach Brewing Company. The fact the brewery managed other interests, including rental housing, partly kept them afloat for a time. Nevertheless, the Fauerbachs were forced to foreclose on the house in 1927.</p><p> The brewery was the only one in Madison to survive prohibition; however, it fell victim to the growth of large commercial breweries and ultimately closed in 1966. The Fauerbach House remained a multi-unit rental property until 1985 when the current owners purchased it. They have since been working on restoring the property, and have converted it back to a single-family dwelling.</p>",img/TLR/fauerbach.png,"Kimberly Hernandez, Amy Brabender, and Jared Lowery"
Hyers Hotel,43.079,-89.36903,854 Jenifer Street,"<p>Hyer's Hotel was built in 1854, the same year the railroad first reached Madison. The building is the oldest surviving hotel in Madison. Italianate in style, it was originally constructed with soft locally produced red brick laid in a five-course common bond. Sandstone sills and lintels provide decorative accents, as does an ornate bracketed cornice. </p><p>The house originally consisted of the two-story brick main block with a wood frame ell to the rear, which had a stable for visitors' horses behind it. An 1874 fire destroyed the wing and stables. When the house was later converted into a single-family residence, a small brick wing was added where the frame wing once stood. </p><p>David Hyer, the builder and first owner, was a member of the first group of settlers to arrive in Madison in 1837; he was employed by Augustus A. Bird in the construction of the first Capitol Building. After trying his luck in the 1848 California Gold Rush, Hyer purchased lots ten and eleven of Block 148 from Leonard Farwell, a prominent land speculator. Tax assessments prior to the construction of the hotel valued the lots at three hundred dollars. After construction of the hotel and livery the property was valued at $2,300. Hyer then sold the property in 1855 to proprietor Henry Jaquish for $9,000, an indication of the boom that was then occurring in Third Lake Ridge. </p><p>The second owner, Henry Jaquish, came to Madison by way of Mineral Point during the lead boom. After a short stint in Mineral Point, he farmed for several years in the village of Mazomanie (western Dane County) before purchasing Hyer's Hotel. Jaquish ran the hotel until the fire in 1874, and lived in the brick portion with his family. </p><p>Jacquish's sale came at a time when the hotel business was saturated. The 1875 Madison city directory reveals a total of twenty-six hotels in Madison, seven of them near the railroad depot. After selling the hotel, Jacquish and his wife remained in the Third Lake Ridge, purchasing a house at 1026 Williamson Street. Following the fire, the building functioned as a single-family residence. Joseph E. Kleiner, president of the Madison Candy Company, purchased the house in 1900. As was true of many other executives associated with area industries, Kleiner lived within walking distance of his company, but also lived along side working-class residents. </p><p>The occupancy of Hyer's Hotel during those first twenty years provides an interesting window into Third Lake Ridge. It appears the hotel provided transient lodging for those seeking work in the growing Third Lake Ridge corridor. The 1858 Madison city directory lists the following residents: two carpenters, two painters, a blacksmith, a laborer, a cabinet-maker, a bookkeeper, a tailor, a feed store employee, and Jaquish. The 1860 manuscript census reveals a similar range of occupations. An even mix of and foreign-born immigrants and East Coast migrs residing in the neighborhood with their families and young children. </p><p>The house continued to operate as a single-family residence during much of the twentieth century. In 1910, Art and Genevieve Schulkamp purchased the house, and lived there through his death in 1972. Schulkamp was a prominent banker, insurance agent, and philanthropist in Madison. </p><p>In 1915, the Schulkamps extensively remodeled the structure by knocking out walls to provide open living spaces that were more in keeping with the progressive styles of the period. The porch was also extended at this time, and other changes were made to the interior with new French doors and modern fixtures. Today the building houses several apartments. Hyer's Hotel became a Madison Landmark in 1975 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.</p>",img/TLR/hyers.png,Jared Lowery
Holver Gabriel House,43.07812,-89.36978,811 Jenifer Street,"<p>Along with other sizable houses in its vicinity, including the John George Ott House standing cattycorner to it, the Holver Gabriel House suggests the affluence of some Third Lake Ridge residents during the first two decades of settlement. Built in 1866, the house was constructed in two sections: a main two-story block, and a slightly shorter two-story side ell. Both sections are built of the then fashionable Milwaukee cream city brick.</p><p>The form of the house represents an update of a popular house form in Third Lake Ridge: the side passage double-pile house (also known as the two-thirds Georgian form). The form was popular in the neighborhood during the first few decades, especially in Greek Revival, examples, including the Fauerbach House  and another example across the Street from the Holver Gabriel House at 820 Jenifer Street. In the Holver Gabriel House, the form has been upgraded in several significant ways. </p><p>The more faddish Italianate style, replete with its flat roof and roof brackets, has replaced the previously modish Greek Revival. In addition, the house has been updated with interior trim in keeping with the style. The casings at the Holver Grabriel House match those found in the neighborhood's other affluent houses from this period. </p><p>This house likely had a basement kitchen. Part of this may have been the siting of the house on a hill sloping towards the lake, but the location of the kitchen also suggests a desire to segregate service functions that became increasingly pronounced in the period. Also notable is the early, if not original, side ell, also built to segregate rooms by function.</p><p>Holver Gabriel, a Norwegian immigrant boot and shoemaker, had this house built in 1866. Born in Norway, Gabriel changed his name from Gabrielson"" between 1860 and 1870 to make it soundless Norwegian. The morphology of Gabriel's name compares favorably with his architectural tastes; he chose a conventional Italianate Villa (likely generated from popular pattern books) versus a more traditional form. </p><p>Unfortunately, it is not known who built the house and little is known about Gabriel and his business beyond the movement of his activities around Madison three times between 1866 and 1875. </p><p>By 1883, Gabriel had sold the house to Hiram Moulton, a builder and contractor from Vermont. Moulton came to Wisconsin in 1854 and initially lived on a farm of 143 acres in the Township of Burke, located about eight miles outside of Madison. Moulton had built several buildings in Madison prior to moving there, including a prominent hotel, so his move to Third Lake Ridge likely related to his business. Like Gabriel, Moulton intended that the house convey his wealth and prominence in the community.</p><p>Prominent residents continued to live at 811 Jenifer Street but their occupations reflect changes in Third Lake Ridge due to industrialization. The next two residents both worked at agricultural machinery shops on the growing ""Implement Row"" </p><p>Instead of segregating themselves in suburban enclaves, these wealthy residents distinguished themselves from their working class neighbors in other ways. The Holver Gabriel House partly stood out because of its imposing size and prominent Victorian ornament, but later changes to the house also served to signify the wealth of its occupants. </p><p>Most significant was the large rear porch added during the closing years of the nineteenth century. This provided a prominent lake view, something increasingly valued by this time. The shoreline of Lake Monona was filled in around the turn of the century, and new houses were erected so as to take advantage of the lakeside views. </p><p>Other houses, including the Harlow S. and Isabelle C. Ott House located next door, had two front facades from the start (a street and lake front). The addition of the porch to the rear of this house likely functioned in a similar context. </p>",img/TLR/holver.png,Jared Lowery and Sydney Dobkin
Madison Candy Company,43.07738,-89.37339,740-44 Williamson Street,"<p>The Madison Candy Company was incorporated on 15 February 1899. This building, which emerged in 1903, was the company's second (the first was located at 625 Williamson Street). Local architect and engineer John Nader designed the new three-story brick building. lt was built in a vernacular commercial style typical of many late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century industrial and commercial structures along Williamson Street and within the east side industrial corridor. </p><p>The rectangular building measures forty-five feet wide and sixty feet long; the only addition is a small loading dock on the rear elevation installed in 1980. The load bearing walls measure over a foot thick. Red brick is used on the facade, while cream city bricks make up the side and rear walls.</p><p> The building is capped by a shed roof, which is partially concealed by a front parapet. Ornament is limited to the main facade; the parapet has rusticated concrete caps punctuated by two windows and a central datestone. Windows have curved segmental arched lintels. Concrete is used to distinguish the beltcourses.</p><p> Besides the rear dock and replacement windows, the only major alteration to the exterior of the building occurred when Williamson Street was widened in 1950; at that time, a large exterior staircase was moved inside the lobby area. The interior has been heavily remodeled. </p><p>The multiple chimney stacks on the building suggest that confectionary operations likely occurred on all floors. Some large beams evident on the first floor suggest the loads of equipment and products that the building once contained. The large and extensive windows on the front and back also suggest that natural lighting was used to illuminate the interior workspace. </p><p>The Madison Candy Company was a prominent confectionary business on the city's industrial east side during the early twentieth century. In 1903, Joseph E Kleiner, president of the company, and his partners, Frank Mosel and T.F. and James Prendergast, lived in the Third Lake Ridge neighborhood, as did many of the company's employees. Kleiner originally lived at 854 Jenifer Street (formerly Hyer's Hotel, see entry), the Prendergast family resided at 731 Jenifer Street, and Frank Mosel lived at 939 Jenifer Street. </p><p>Business must have been steady since all of these individuals built prominent architect-designed houses in Third Lake Ridge before 1910.</p><p>After the Madison Candy Company closed, the building went through a number of commercial uses. The Richard Ela Welding Company occupied the building for several decades during the middle of the twentieth century; and an agricultural implement shop was also housed there for a period.</p><p> A Madison City Landmark, the Candy Company building currently houses a restaurant (El Dorado Grill), a coffeehouse (Ground Zero), and office space. Historic photographs of the building are hung on the interior walls.</p>",img/TLR/candyco.png,Jared Lowery
Machinery Row,43.076179,-89.37538,601-627 Williamson Street," <p>Designed by Conover and Porter, ""Machinery Row"" is a series of Romanesque-revival style buildings sporadically constructed for agricultural implement houses between 1898 and 1914. The Williamson Street structures were constructed as follows: 601-607 (1898); 621-623 (1899); 613-615 (1901); 625-627 (1902); and 609-611 (sometime after 1902). By 1899, companies such as the Advance Thresher Company, Case J.I. Threshing Company, Champion Harvesting Machinery, Milwaukee Harvester Company, Osborn D.M. and Company, and Syracuse Chilled Plow Company were all located in Machinery Row.</p><p> The headquarters of these companies were in other midwestern cities where the agricultural implements were manufactured, but field offices such as those in Madison helped the businesses reach broader markets. The Machinery Row offices combined showroom space, service centers, and financial offices. </p><p>Machinery Row is actually a series of brick buildings designed behind a unified facade. It is built largely of Milwaukee ""cream city"" bricks with stone and tile trim on a sturdy sandstone foundation. Distinguishing features include the tower at the northwestern corner and the crenellated cornice on the street facade. Modern changes mainly involve door and window openings and replacement doors and sash. </p><p>Another major change occurred when rail sidings were removed from behind the building where the modern parking lot is located.</p><p>Machinery Row was part of Madison's industrial sector,  collectively known as ""Implement Row."" This label referred to a set of dealers who occupied several blocks on Williamson Street and adjacent Blount Street, where they clustered near the railroad. Before the current structure was erected, the property housed a series of wood-framed structures that catered to the tobacco and ice harvesting industries. </p><p>As more railroads came to Madison and existing spurs were improved, agricultural implement companies seized on the opportunity to sell their products. In 1898 a wealthy banker who acknowledged the demand bought the Daggett-Hill Property and started to replace the wooden structures in piecemeal fashion with existing buildings. By 1902 the property was listed as Madison's second highest taxpayer.</p><p>Almost as soon as Madison experienced a sharp rise in agricultural implement houses, consolidation occurred in the industry. In 1902 J.P. Morgan brokered a merger between McCormick and five other implement companies to form the International Harvester Company (IHC). This move gave IHC a massive amount of capital, along with manufacturing facilities and intellectual property that the smaller implement companies could not compete against. </p><p>The decline in agricultural implement companies that subsequently occurred is reflected in the 1907 Madison City Directory, which lists seventeen implement branches. Likewise, Machinery Row reflects the same pattern. In 1904 seven implement companies were listed at the address, but by 1907 there were only three. </p><p>As industrial properties moved out of Machinery Row, commercial uses took over, which is how the building functions today. It is a contributing element to  the Third Lake Ridge Landmark District and also serves  as a local Madison Landmark.</p>",img/TLR/machineryrow.png,Jared Lowery
Klose Cottage,43.07792,-89.37123,748 Jenifer Street,"<p>The residence known locally as the Klose Cottage"" is an upright and wing house built in 1863. A woodframe house, it is clad with clapboard and vertical board siding. Many of the original four over four windows remain, as do the original doors and interior trim. The property has changed relatively little during the past one hundred and fifty years; only a bump-out bathroom was added off the rear when the house was converted into a two-unit building in 1959. The fact that it has experienced so little change makes the Klose Cottage perhaps the best surviving example of a once ubiquitous house form in the Third Lake Ridge neighborhood.</p><p>According to Tom Hubka, upright and wings (also known as cross-wings, temple front and wings, and other labels) are distinguished by their T-shaped massing. The T-shape allows for the separation of distinct portions of the house by function. The kitchen is usually in the side-gabled wing, as is evident at the Klose Cottage. The more formal public spaces of the house are in the ""upright"" (front gabled) portion of the house, which in this example is entered through a second front door (a common variation). </p><p>Despite its widespread popularity nationally, there is no agreement (even locally) about what to call this popular house type. The popular development of this plan followed early nineteenth-century Western expansion, and it became a dominant Midwestern farmhouse form. The Klose Cottage and countless other examples show it was just as popular in urban settlements throughout the Midwest as well as elsewhere.</p><p>Although the home is associated with a later owner, it was built originally for James Ledwith. He was born in Ireland in 1839 and immigrated to the United States in 1848, likely fleeing the potato famine. He lived in Troy, New York, until 1855 and then moved to Madison. There is no evidence of any other Ledwiths in Wisconsin at this time so it is likely he made the journey west by himself at the age of sixteen. </p><p>The 1858 Madison city directory lists Ledwith, a blacksmith, as boarding at the Wisconsin House (likely Wisconsin Inn on Williamson Street). In 1860 he married Ellen Whalen, also an Irish immigrant, and that year they had their first child. </p><p>Ledwith's house was built during the early years of the boom (1850s and early 1860s) in the Third Lake Ridge neighborhood. Some of this activity was due to the rise of lumber mills as well as new materials brought in by the railroad; the paper continued by noting that ""one stimulus to building this season is the fact that materials are much cheaper, as we are informed, than usual.""</p><p>Although the panic of 1857 quelled building activity somewhat, it did not cease; Ledwith, for example, needed a new house for his family, which now included a new baby. Therefore, Ledwith, a blacksmith and a wagon maker, built the house himself in 1863. Aldolph Klose, a German tailor, was the next resident of 748 Jenifer; he lived there sometime from the 1870s through 1886. </p><p>After this, the house went through a series of residents, most of whom worked at working-class occupations associated with industries in Third Lake Ridge. These include Andrew Hippenmeyer, Jr., a butcher (1886-1902); Hugo Vogel, a collector at MG&E (1907-1946); and several individuals who, during the later twentieth century, worked for the railroad or at nearby Gisholt Manufacturing Company.</p>",img/TLR/klose.png,Julia Griffith and Jared Lowery
L.L. Olds Seed Company,43.07775,-89.37279,722 Williamson Street,"<p>The activities that took place inside the L. L. Olds Seed Company affected many acres of land beyond the Third Lake Ridge neighborhood. Founded in 1888 as a mail order company operating out of Clinton, Wisconsin (between Madison and Chicago), Olds Seed was a large seed packer and distributor with a national market. After expanding beyond its mail order business, the company, in 1914, erected its headquarters at 722 Williamson, where a rail line was available to facilitate the distribution of Old Seeds products. Initially the company specialized in potatoes but gradually expanded, eventually developing a large line of seeds that were used by people who wished to maintain neatly manicured suburban lawns and gardens.</p><p>The Olds Seed Company building is a four-story structure built of steel reinforced concrete clad in brick veneer. It was designed in 1914 by Alvan Small, a locally renowned Prairie-school architect. Minimal prairie-style detailing may be seen at the roofline and around the doorways, although it is largely similar to  the industrial and commercial buildings found throughout Madison's east side corridor. A streamlined neo-classical doorway is found on the eastern end of the facade. </p><p>L.L. Olds, founder of the company that bears his name, was born in Rock County, Wisconsin, and grew up on a potato farm near Clinton. Olds started his mail order catalog company in 1888 by mailing out five hundred copies of a catalog that emphasized his specialty: potatoes. All of the seeds came from a single source: his two hundred acre farm. In 1893 Olds Seed participated in the Columbian World's Exposition (Chicago) and exhibited sixty-five varieties of potatoes, including one new variety. Their catalog not only included potatoes, but also corn, oats, barely, and a few garden seeds. In 1895 Olds doubled the capacity of the warehouse on his farm and eventually built a new three-story facility located along the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad tracks in Clinton. Although a 1908 a fire destroyed this warehouse (and a $24,000 inventory), the company was growing at such a pace that the conflagration did little to slow its growth. </p><p>Olds Seed moved to Madison in 1908, originally to Wilson Street and eventually to the handsome headquarters at 722 Williamson. Although Olds could have chosen either Chicago or Rockford, Illinois, as a location for his business, he was interested in Madison because of its good rail connections and proximity to the University of Wisconsin. His move to Madison demonstrates the degree to which he valued agricultural research. Olds briefly lived in the Third Lake Ridge neighborhood at 840 Spaight Street before moving to Madison's near west side suburb of University Heights. </p><p>Olds Seeds remained in the building until 1972, at which point it relocated elsewhere in Madison. The building has gone through a number of subsequent transformations a part of adaptive reuse efforts, but still retains its basic exterior form.</p>",img/TLR/olds.png,Jared Lowery
Mosel House,43.0781,-89.37031,812 Jenifer Street,"<p>The Mosel House is a two-and-one-half story foursquare with notable arts and crafts details. It was built as an eight-bedroom single-family home between 1909 and 1911, and has since served as a multi-family residence and most recently as the Syntropy Co-op. The Mosel House is an excellent example of the arts and crafts style that was popular in Third Lake Ridge during the first two decades of the twentieth century.</p><p>Despite many shifts in occupancy, the house retains much of its original form and wonderful interior arts and crafts details. The foursquare form is readily apparent, with the basic four room over four room"" configuration still obvious even as the rooms in the upper floors have been subdivided. Arts and crafts details are most evident in the leaded glass windows on the first floor as well as the woodwork. </p><p>Particularly notable is the elaborate first-floor fireplace mantle with ionic pilasters and intricate carved detail. The brick one-story porch is also original to the house (though modified numerous times), and only a few modest changes have been made to the footprint at the rear, most prior to the publication of the 1942 Sanborn map.</p><p>Perhaps designed by local architect Ferdinand Kronenberg, the house was built for Frank and Emma Mosel and their five children, who lived there between the time it was constructed and 1930. Frank Mosel worked at the Brewer-Mosel Auto Company (as president) and was also the treasurer of the Madison Candy Company, both within easy walking distance of the house.</p><p> The Mosels lost the home during the Depression, during which time it passed through a series of owners and was likely a rental property for a period. Benjamin and Mabel Cowan purchased the house in 1942 and owned it through the 1970s. During this period they housed a number of lodgers. </p><p>After the house was sold in 1972, it operated as the headquarters of the Lion Players Theater and eventually became a co-op; initially the Sufi Co-Op operated there, and in 1983 it became the Syntropy Co-op under the ownership of the Madison Community Cooperative.</p>",img/TLR/mosel.png,"Julia Griffith, Christine Huerta, Julie Jones and Olivia Zabel"
Madison Gas & Electric Powerhouse,43.079202,-89.375404,717 East Main Street,"<p>The original section of the Madison Gas and Electric (MG&E) Powerhouse was built in 1902, with a large addition erected in 1915. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society's website, the ""Neoclassical designs for both portions, symbolized the power of early twentieth century institutions and helped to market an image of this private utility as a ""public servant."" Numerous additions to the power plant are the result of the need to increase capacity for a growing population as well as new technology. Because the company was privately owned, the additions also symbolize increased profits the company realized as the sole provider of gas and electricity in Madison. By 1912 MG&E employed 119 people; the 1939 figure grew to 270 employees, many of who lived in Third Lake Ridge.</p><p>The MG&E Powerhouse occupies a block bounded by Railroad Avenue and South Blount, East Main, and South Livingston Streets. The powerhouse faces South Blount. The main (western) facade is divided into two sections that have discrete functions. The northernmost section functions as the generator house, while the southernmost contains the boiler house. </p><p>As the plant expanded to the rear, the functions were largely maintained in the same sections. The prominent Madison architectural firm of Claude and Starck designed the facades, while the Chicago-based engineering firm of Mead and Seastone was responsible for the design of the actual plant. </p><p>The exterior walls of the 1902 and 1915 sections are built in red brick, which rest on a concrete foundation faced with stone.</p><p> The neo-classical appearance of the 1902 facade, which displays brick pilasters that breakup the long wall and a centrally-placed stone entry with simplified classical surrounds, masks the industrial function of the building; as the Madison Landmark nomination for the property states, the building could ""look like a library."" The 1915 section contains many features seen in the 1902 unit, though it looks more industrial, partly because of the multi-pane industrial windows that pierce the walls.</p><p> In general, similar neo-classical details are found in this section. It should be noted, however, that some craftsman features exist in places, such as the north facade, which reflects the fact Claude and Starck often worked in more ""progressive"" modes. A modern wall (built in 2000) now obscures the building's southern wall. Later additions, most revealing an industrial-commercial style, are found elsewhere on the property.</p><p>MG&E was a major employer on Madison's industrial east side during the twentieth century, and also served as a critical utility for other businesses. Power was needed to supply the machine shops on the east side, such as Fuller and Johnson and Gisholt Machines (at one time the fifth largest machine maker in the country), to name just two of the major players.</p><p>The plant has recently (in late 2011) been converted from a coal-burning facility to one that only utilizes natural gas. There are no plans to retire the plant, although MG&E is currently pursuing renewable energy sources, which may affect the facility's future.</p>",img/TLR/mge.png,Jared Lowery
Timothy and Katherine McCarthy House,43.0789,-89.36943,848 Jenifer Street,"<p>The Timothy and Katherine McCarthy House is a well-preserved example of a Queen Anneresidence, readily apparent with its expansive porches, bay windows, Victorian ornamentation, and elaborate interior. The two-and-one-half story frame house was designed by the Madison based architectural firm of Conover & Porter. It is clad with narrow clapboard siding and rests on a rose-colored sandstone foundation. The house has a complex hipped roof with several cross gables. Ironwork on the north side is original, as are prominent patterned brick and stone chimneys. Prominent Madison builder and contractor T.C. McCarthy built the home to serve the dual purpose of residence and business office. </p><p>One of the most striking aspects of the McCarthy House is its well-preserved interior. The first floor plan is largely intact, as is much of the woodwork, metal hardware, and other interior features. The entry vestibule contains a leaded glass window and Lincrusta Walton wainscoting, both of which are original. Much of the interior woodwork is done in white oak, including the newel post, dining room wainscoting, and fireplace surrounds. The woodwork on the second floor is primarily Douglas fir, except for the master bedroom, which uses oak to match the first floor. An elaborate, highly crafted stairhall provides access to the first-floor music room and parlor, which are divided by large original pocket doors. The stairhall woodwork is complemented by wood details in the dining room and parlor. A service stair off the kitchen provides access to a second-floor servant's bedroom. The master bedroom also contains a fireplace, with ornamentation similar to that of the fireplace in the parlor. </p><p>Timothy C. (T.C.) McCarthy was a prominent Madison builder and contractor during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. McCarthy was responsible for many prominent public buildings, beginning with his first known commission, the 1883 Dane County Courthouse. He was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1853; and came to Madison in 1854, initially working as a stonemason under David Stevens. McCarthy started his own firm shortly thereafter, specializing in bricklaying and masonry. McCarthy experienced large-scale success when he began working with the architects Allan Conover and Lew Porter. With them, he would build several prominent University of Wisconsin campus buildings, including the Armory/Gymnasium (Red Gym), Science Hall, and Agricultural Hall. At the time of McCarthy's death in 1928, his obituary characterized him as the leading contractor in Madison prior to 1910.</p><p>Given his financial success, it is interesting to note that McCarthy built his home in the increasingly dense, industrializing, working-class landscape of Third Lake Ridge in 1897. During this time new neighborhoods on the west side such as Wingra Park and University Heights were being developed for upper class Madisonians, and Connover and Porter were involved with their development. Perhaps it was his economic interest in the neighborhood, where Connover and Porter were active, or it may have been the fact Third Lake Ridge remained, even as it changed somewhat with the industrial boom of the later nineteenth century, becoming a place where middling and upper-class residents lived alongside one another. McCarthy lived at 848 Jenifer until 1928 when he passed away in his home.</p><p>Like many older structures in Third Lake Ridge, the house has undergone a series of transformations. After the home passed out of the McCarthy family in 1930, it was broken up into rental apartments. During the 1970s it became a home for delinquent boys. The current owner began restoring the property in 1988 and returned it to its single-family use. The preservation of the interior is remarkable, given the half-century of rental use. The house is a Madison Landmark, and a contributing element to the Third Lake Ridge local historic district.</p>",img/TLR/mcarthy.png,"Brittany Breeze, Emma Stepien, Lauren Slattery, and Jared Lowery"
Heitkamp Wagon Maker Shop,43.078453,-89.37115,811 Williamson Street,"<p>The Heitkamp Wagon Maker Shop illustrates a common ""mixed use"" form in the Third Lake Ridge neighborhood. The gable-fronted structure was first constructed in 1872 by William Heitkamp for his trade and residence. Heitkamp and his sons worked out of the building for close to two decades. It is built of soft locally-produced red brick; some of the windows reveal original stone sills and lintels.</p><p>Heitkamp immigrated to Wisconsin from Prussia in 1855 and first moved to Cottage Grove (about ten miles southwest of downtown Madison), where he became a farmer.</p><p> He started purchasing property in Madison in 1862 and in 1865 purchased lot number two on block 148 from George Delaplaine, a wealthy land owner and secretary of the United States Commission on Public Buildings, who owned large amounts of land in and outside of Madison. Heitkamp  apprenticed as a blacksmith and used this experience when he opened the Wagon Maker Shop.</p><p>Like other structures on the southeastern side of Williamson Street, the Heitkamp Wagon Maker Shop is banked into a hill. </p><p>This puts the basement on street level, which allows space for production and easy wagon access while providing domestic space above. This was a common configuration in the Third Lake Ridge neighborhood before 1900, where living quarters sat atop workspaces.</p><p>The building has undergone few significant changes in its form and massing. A side addition, evident in an 1890 photograph, was present briefly, but according to Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, was demolished between 1898 and 1902. The most notable changes have been in the use of the building. </p><p>After several decades, it was bought by carriage-makers Adam Gelger and Ole Williamson, and acted as the location for their business as well as a rental property. During this time, Gelger's son, John, lived with his family in the property, and continued his business of making carriages until the following year. From 1901 through 1930, the building existed either only as an apartment or, for two short, separate stints, as the location for home laundry services. </p><p>The most significant change in use started in 1931 when the structure became the location for Auto Radiator Service under the ownership of M. Erma Wilcox. While it went through many different owners and name changes, the building, for nearly forty years, remained as some sort of automobile garage or repair shop.</p>",img/TLR/wagon.png,"Ben Blohoweak, Sarah McCarty, Jack Mclaughlin, Kendall Parisi, Becca Rosenberg, and Hanna Shesto"
